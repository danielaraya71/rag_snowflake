 security integration. The security integration is an account-level object and can’t be
included in any backup.
Types of objects in database and schema backups
¶
The following table lists the objects that are included in a database or schema backup:
Object
Included in backup
Notes
Permanent tables
Yes
Time Travel information for tables isn’t stored as part of a backup.
Transient tables
Yes
Such tables continue to be transient tables after you restore them.
Transient schemas and transient databases also retain the transient property
after you restore them.
Temporary tables
No
Temporary tables are session scoped and aren’t included in backups.
Dynamic tables
Yes
Dynamic tables have their own data definition language (DDL) syntax for backups. You can run
CREATE BACKUP SET FOR DYNAMIC TABLE and CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE FROM BACKUP SET commands.
When you restore a dynamic table from a backup, the table is restored in a suspended state.

Tasks
Yes
Tasks are included in the backup. Tasks restored from a backup are suspended and must be resumed.
Data metric functions (DMFs)

Policies
Yes
The following kinds of policies are included in a schema or database backup:
Column-level security (masking)
Row access policies
Tag-based masking policies
If any table included in the backup has any other kind of policy applied (for example an
aggregation policy, a projection policy, or a storage lifecycle policy), backup creation
fails.
Grants
Yes
If you drop a role, associated ownership grants are transferred to the role that
performs the DROP
