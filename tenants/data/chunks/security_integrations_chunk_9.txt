. Network rules are schema-level objects
and are replicated with the database in which they are contained. For example:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
network policies
,
databases
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
testdb2
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2
;
Copy
Network policies assigned to an account
The replication or failover group must include
network
policies
and
account
parameters
. If the network policy uses
network rules, you must also include
databases
. For example:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
network policies
,
account
parameters
,
databases
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
testdb2
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2
;
Copy
Network policies assigned to a user
The replication or failover group must include
network
policies
and
users
. If the network policy uses network rules, you
must also include
databases
. For example:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
network policies
,
users
,
databases
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
testdb2
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2

Copy
Network policies assigned to a security integration
Network policy replication applies to network policies that are specified in Snowflake OAuth and SCIM
security integrations
, provided that the replication or failover group includes
integrations
,
security
integrations
and
network
policies
. If the network policy uses network rules, you must also
include
databases
.
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
network policies
,
integrations
,
databases
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
testdb2
ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES
=
security

Example
¶
For this example, assume the following:
Source account:
https://example-northamericawest.snowflakecomputing.com/
Target account:
https://example-northamericaeast.snowflakecomputing.com/
Connection URL:
https://example-global.snowflakecomputing.com
A secondary connection exists in the target account (i.e. only refresh operations are needed).
