 that is referenced in the integration.
If you replicate the secret and do not replicate the integration from
account1
to
account2
, the integration doesn’t work in the
target account (
account2
) because there is no integration to use the secret. Additionally, if you failover and the target account is
promoted to source account, the integration will not work.
When you decide to failover to make
account1
as the source account, the secret and integration references match and the placeholder
secret is not used. This allows you to use the security integration and the secret that contains the credentials because the objects can
reference each other.
Replication and cloning
¶
Historically
Cloned objects
were replicated physically rather than logically to secondary databases. That is,
cloned tables in a standard database don’t contribute to the overall data storage unless or until DML operations on the clone
add to or modify existing data. However, when a cloned table is replicated to a secondary database, the physical data is also replicated,
increasing the data storage usage for your account.
A logically replicated cloned table shares the micro-partitions of the original table it was cloned from,
reducing the physical storage of the secondary table in the target account.
If the original table and cloned table are included in the same replication or failover group, the cloned table can be replicated
logically to the target account.
Logical replication of clones
¶
If the original and cloned table are included in the same replication or failover group, the cloned table can be replicated
logically to the target account.
For example, if table
t2
in database
db2
is a clone of table
t1
in database
db1
, and both databases are included
in replication group
rg1
, then table
t2
is created as a logical clone in the target account.
A cloned object can be cloned to create additional clones of the original object. The original object and the cloned objects are part
of the same
clone group
. For example, if table
t3
in database
db3
is created as a clone of
t2
, it is in the same clone group
as the original table
t1
and the cloned table
t2
.
If database
db3
is later added to the replication group
rg1
, table
t3
is created in the
