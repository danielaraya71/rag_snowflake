 object, not the restored one. That’s true even
if you rename the restored object to the same name as the original object. If you want to continue using the
same backup set after doing a restore, you restore the object under a new name
and then transfer data back to the original object.
CREATE DATABASE FROM BACKUP SET
CREATE SCHEMA FROM BACKUP SET
CREATE TABLE FROM BACKUP SET

Terminology change
¶
The feature is now called
backups
instead of snapshots. All SQL commands, views, and privileges use
BACKUP
terminology:
CREATE BACKUP POLICY, CREATE BACKUP SET
ALTER BACKUP POLICY, ALTER BACKUP SET
DROP BACKUP POLICY, DROP BACKUP SET
SHOW BACKUP POLICIES, SHOW BACKUP SETS, SHOW BACKUPS IN BACKUP SET
BACKUPS, BACKUP_POLICIES, BACKUP_SETS views in Account Usage, Organization Usage, and Information Schema
APPLY BACKUP POLICY, APPLY BACKUP RETENTION LOCK privileges
The former SNAPSHOT/SNAPSHOTS names are still present but deprecated in favor of their BACKUP/BACKUPS equivalents.
For example:
CREATE SNAPSHOT POLICY is deprecated; use CREATE BACKUP POLICY instead.
SNAPSHOTS view is deprecated; use BACKUPS view instead.
APPLY SNAPSHOT POLICY privilege is deprecated; use APPLY BACKUP POL
