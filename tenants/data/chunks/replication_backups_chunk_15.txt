Suspend a backup policy on a backup set
¶
When you suspend a backup policy on a backup set, you prevent the backup policy from being used to create
new scheduled backups in that backup set. You also suspend the expiration of existing backups in that
backup set that use the backup policy. Other backup sets that use the same policy aren’t affected.
The following example suspends a backup policy on the backup set
t2_backups
:
ALTER
BACKUP
SET
t2_backups
SUSPEND
BACKUP
POLICY
;
Copy
You can also selectively suspend just the creation or just the expiration processes of the backup set.
The following example suspends the creation of new backups in the backup set
t3_backups
, and
suspends expiration of old backups from the backup set
t4_backups
:
ALTER
BACKUP
SET
t3_backups
SUSPEND
BACKUP
CREATION
POLICY
;
ALTER
BACKUP
SET
t4_backups
SUSPEND
BACKUP

Resume a backup policy on a backup set
¶
You can resume suspended backup policies. Doing so resumes the creation and expiration of backups according to the backup
policy. If any backups reached their expiration time while the policy was suspended, Snowflake deletes those backups as soon as
the policy is resumed.
The following example resumes a backup policy on the backup set
t1_backup
:
ALTER
BACKUP
SET
t1_backups
RESUME
BACKUP
POLICY
;
Copy
You can also selectively resume just the creation or just the expiration processes of the backup set.
The following example resumes the creation of new backups in the backup set
t3_backups
, and
resumes expiration of old backups from the backup set
t4_backups
:
ALTER
BACKUP
SET
t3_backups
