If private connectivity to the Snowflake service is enabled for your Snowflake account, you must create
or update a DNS CNAME record for your connection URL. For more details, see
Modifying the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
.
Configuring Client Redirect
¶
This section describes how to create a primary connection and one or more secondary connections in a connection group.
Prerequisite
¶
To enable the Client Redirect feature for your accounts, an
organization administrator
must enable
replication for two or more accounts. To enable replication, see
Prerequisite: Enable replication for accounts in the organization
for detailed instructions.
Create a primary connection
¶
Important
Snowflake assigned your organization a unique, generated name when it was created in the system. The organization name is a part of the
connection URL defined in a connection object and submitted by Snowflake clients to access an account. Before you create any connection
objects, verify that your organization name in Snowflake is satisfactory. To change your organization name in the system, contact
Snowflake Support
.
You can create a primary connection in the source account using Snowsight or
SQL
.
Create a primary and secondary connection using Snowsight
¶
To create a connection using Snowsight, complete the following steps:
Note
Only a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a connection using Snowsight.
You must be signed in to the target account as a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role. If not, you will be prompted to sign in.
Currently, if your account uses private connectivity, you can’t use Snowsight to create a primary and secondary
connection.
