This topic describes the steps necessary to fail over replicated account objects across multiple accounts in different
regions
for disaster recovery.
For information about the purpose of the failover mechanism and when to use it, see
Introduction to business continuity & disaster recovery
.
Prerequisites
¶
Enable replication in a set of accounts within the same organization, across multiple regions in one cloud service provider
or across different cloud service providers.
Create a primary failover group that defines the kinds of objects to replicate, and specifies the target accounts
to which to replicate. You can optionally divide the replicated objects across multiple failover groups, for example if
some databases should be replicated more frequently than others.
Create at least one secondary failover group (replica) of each primary failover group in one or more secondary accounts.
Refresh (synchronize) each replica with the latest updates to the objects in the failover group. Perform an
initial refresh, and set up a schedule to regularly bring the latest changes to each secondary account.
For instructions, see
Replicating account objects and databases
.
Promote a target account to serve as the source account
¶
You can promote a target account to serve as the source account (failover) using Snowsight or
SQL
.
For more information about the kinds of objects you can specify in a failover group,
see
Replication groups and failover groups
.
Promote a target account to serve as the source account using Snowsight
¶
Note
Only account administrators can edit a replication or failover group using Snowsight (see
Limitations of using Snowsight for replication configuration
).
For the most consistent and reliable failover experience, select all the applicable failover groups and
connections and promote them all at the same time. We refer to this operation as a
bulk failover
.
To promote a target account to serve as the source account using Snowsight, follow these steps:
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
Make sure to sign in using the target account
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Replication
, then select
Initiate failover
. Doing so brings up a dialog where you make the remaining choices.
Select any failover groups to promote.  After the failover, the objects specified in those
failover groups become writable on the newly promoted primary account. Those objects become
read-only on the account that formerly was the primary and is now a secondary account.
Select
Next
.
Select any connections to promote. After the failover, those connections connect to the account
that you’re promoting to be the new primary account.
Select
Next
.
Select
Fail over
in the confirmation window.
If any refresh operations are in progress for the failover groups you selected, you can wait for those refreshes
to complete, or choose an alternative approach if your failover is urgent and should take priority.
The default action is to wait for the refreshes to complete. That way, the primary and secondary systems are all
in a consistent state when the bulk failover runs. Snowflake uses your currently selected warehouse to poll the
status of the ongoing refreshes. If you don’t have a selected warehouse, you select one now using the
Select warehouse
option.
Or, you can proceed with the failover immediately by selecting
Show advanced options
.
To fail over only the failover groups that aren’t currently being refreshed, select
Exit with current progress
.
In that case, you perform additional refreshes later for the groups that were skipped during the bulk failover.
To cancel the refresh operations and continue the failover, select
Cancel refreshes and force failover
.
In that case, you might need to clean up any inconsistencies on the secondary system from the interrupted refreshes.
If the failover operation didn’t complete for all failover groups, you can perform another bulk failover. Or you can fail over
the remaining failover groups one at a time, using the procedure in
Promote a single failover group to serve as the primary using Snowsight
.
Promote a single failover group to serve as the primary using Snowsight
¶
Note
Only account administrators can edit a replication or failover group using Snowsight (see
Limitations of using Snowsight for replication configuration
).
To promote a single failover group to be the primary using Snowsight, follow these steps:
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
Make sure to sign in using the target account
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Replication
, then select
Groups
.
Locate the failover group that you want to promote, and select the
More
menu (
…
) in the last column of the row.
Select
Fail over
, then select
Fail over
in the confirmation window.
Tip
You typically use this procedure if you encounter a problem failing over one group, and you need to retry the
failover only for that group. To promote an entire account to be the primary, select multiple failover groups and connections and
perform a bulk failover. For more information, see
Promote a target account to serve as the source account using Snowsight
.
Promote a target account to serve as the source account using SQL
¶
To promote a target account to serve as the source account using SQL, you sign in to the target account
and execute the
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP … PRIMARY
command.
Promote a secondary failover group to primary failover group
¶
Note
The example in this section must be executed by a role with the FAILOVER privilege.
The following example promotes
myaccount2
in the current
myorg
organization to serve as the source account.
Sign in to target account
myaccount2
.
List failover groups in the account:
SHOW FAILOVER GROUPS
;
Copy
Execute the following statement for each secondary failover group you want to promote to serve as the primary failover group:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
PRIMARY
;
Copy
Note
During a partial outage in your source region, the replication service might continue to be available and might continue
to refresh the secondary failover groups in target regions.
To ensure data integrity, Snowflake prevents failover if a refresh operation is in progress. This means you cannot
promote a secondary failover group to serve as the primary if it is being refreshed by a replication operation.
The ALTER FAILOVER GROUP … PRIMARY command returns an error in this scenario.
Resolving failover statement failure due to an in-progress refresh operation
¶
If there is a refresh operation in progress for the secondary failover group you are trying to promote, the failover statement
results in the following error:
Replication group "<GROUP_NAME>" cannot currently be set as primary because it is being
refreshed. Either wait for the refresh to finish or cancel the refresh and try again.
To successfully fail over, you must complete the following steps.
Select and complete one of the following options:
Important
Suspending a refresh operation in the SECONDARY_DOWNLOADING_METADATA or SECONDARY_DOWNLOADING_DATA phase
might result in an inconsistent state on the target account. For more information, see
View the current phase of an in-progress refresh operation
.
Suspend future refresh operations for the failover group. If there is an in-progress refresh operation, you must wait for
it to complete before you can failover:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
SUSPEND
;
Copy
Suspend future refresh operations
and
cancel a scheduled refresh operation that is currently in progress (if there is one).
If the in-progress refresh operation was manually triggered, see
Cancel an in-progress refresh operation that wasn’t automatically scheduled
.
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
SUSPEND
IMMEDIATE
;
Copy
Note
You might experience a slight delay between the time that the statement returns and the time that the cancellation
of the refresh operation is finished.
Verify no refresh operations are in progress for the failover group
myfg
. The following query
should return no results:
SELECT
phase_name
,
start_time
,
job_uuid
FROM
TABLE
(
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY
(
'myfg'
))
WHERE
phase_name
<>
'COMPLETED'
and
phase_name
<>
'CANCELED'
;
Copy
To see canceled refresh operations for failover group
myfg
, you can execute the following statement:
SELECT
phase_name
,
start_time
,
job_uuid
FROM
TABLE
(
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY
(
'myfg'
))
WHERE
phase_name
=
'CANCELED'
;
Copy
Now you can promote the secondary failover group
myfg
to primary failover group:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
PRIMARY
;
Copy
Resume scheduled replication in target accounts
¶
On failover, scheduled refreshes on all secondary failover groups are suspended.
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP … RESUME
must be executed in each
target account
with a
secondary failover group to resume automatic refreshes.
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
RESUME
;
Copy
View the current phase of an in-progress refresh operation
¶
A refresh operation can be safely canceled during most phases of the refresh operation. However, canceling a refresh operation
in the SECONDARY_DOWNLOADING_METADATA or SECONDARY_DOWNLOADING_DATA phase might result in an inconsistent state on the target
account.  If the refresh operation has started one of these phases, it proceeds to completion regardless of the availability of
the source account. Allowing the phase to complete before you fail over ensures replicas are in a consistent state.
After the replicas are in a consistent state, you can resume or replay your ingest and transformation pipelines to update the
replicas to the current state.
To view the current phase of an in-progress refresh operation for a failover group, use the Information Schema
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS, REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS_BY_JOB, REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS_ALL
table function.
For example, to view the current phase of an in-progress refresh operation for failover group
myfg
, execute
the following statement:
SELECT
phase_name
,
start_time
,
end_time
FROM
TABLE
(
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS
(
'myfg'
)
);
Copy
For a list of refresh operations phases, see the
usage notes
for the function.
Cancel an in-progress refresh operation that wasn’t automatically scheduled
¶
To cancel an in-progress refresh operation that was not triggered automatically by a replication schedule, you must use the
SYSTEM$CANCEL_QUERY
function:
Find the query ID or JOB_UUID for running refresh operations using one of the following options:
Find the query IDs for all running refresh operations:
SELECT
query_id
,
query_text
FROM
TABLE
(
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
QUERY_HISTORY
())
WHERE
query_type
=
'REFRESH REPLICATION GROUP'
AND
execution_status
=
'RUNNING'
ORDER
BY
start_time
;
Copy
Use the QUERY_TEXT column to identify the QUERY_ID for failover group refresh operations from the list.
Find the JOB_UUID for an in-progress refresh operation for a specific failover group
myfg
:
SELECT
phase_name
,
start_time
,
job_uuid
FROM
TABLE
(
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY
(
'myfg'
))
WHERE
phase_name
<>
'COMPLETED'
and
phase_name
<>
'CANCELED'
;
Copy
Cancel the refresh operation using the SYSTEM$CANCEL_QUERY function and the QUERY_ID or JOB_UUID:
SELECT
SYSTEM$CANCEL_QUERY
(
'<QUERY_ID | JOB_UUID>'
);
Copy
Returns the following output:
query [<QUERY_ID>] terminated.
After you cancel the in-progress refresh operation, continue to the
next steps
.
Reopen active channels for Snowpipe Streaming in newly promoted source account
¶
Tables in a primary database that are populated by
Snowpipe Streaming are replicated
to secondary databases. After failover, reopen active Snowpipe Streaming channels for tables and re-insert any missing data rows
for the channels:
Reopen active channels for the table by calling the
openChannel
API.
Fetch offset tokens:
Call the
getLatestCommittedOffsetToken
API
or
Execute the
SHOW CHANNELS
command to retrieve a list of the active channels of the table.
Re-insert data rows for the channel from the fetched offset tokens.
Note
These steps apply only to Snowpipe Streaming with the Snowflake Ingest SDK; it doesn’t apply to Snowpipe Streaming with the Kafka connector. Follow
the steps below
to restart the Kafka Connector after failover.
Snowpipe Streaming and the Kafka connector
¶
If you are using the Kafka connector and Snowpipe Streaming, follow these steps after failover:
Update the Kafka connector configuration to point to the newly promoted source account.
Execute the SHOW CHANNELS command to retrieve the list of active channels and the offset tokens. Each channel belongs to a
single partition in the Kafka topic.
Manually reset offsets in the Kafka Topic for each of those partitions (channels).
Restart the Kafka Connector.
