Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).

Considerations for replicating Git repository clones
¶
To replicate any Git repository objects that you’ve integrated with Snowflake,
you specify the database or schema that contains the Git repository object
in a replication group or a failover group. You don’t have to perform any
separate step to enable replication for Git repository clones.
The secrets from the primary system are replicated to the secondary system.
On the secondary system, you can read from the repository. However, you can’t commit, fetch from, or push to
the remote
origin
server from the secondary system. After you promote the secondary system to be the primary
by failing over, you can perform these other operations on the Git repository.
Snowflake supports replication for Git repository clones up to 5 GB in size. Larger repositories currently aren’t supported.
