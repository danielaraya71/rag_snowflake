Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts
¶
Standard and Business Critical Feature
Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
This feature enables the replication of objects from a
source
account to one or more
target
accounts in the same organization.
Replicated objects in each target account are referred to as
secondary
objects and are replicas of the
primary
objects in the source
account. Replication is supported across
regions
and across
cloud platforms
.
Region support for replication and failover/failback
¶
All Snowflake regions across Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure support replication.
Customers can replicate across all regions within a
region group
. To replicate between regions in
different region groups, (i.e. from a Snowflake commercial region to a Snowflake government or Virtual Private Snowflake region),
please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Replication groups and failover groups
¶
A
replication group
is a defined collection of objects in a source account that are replicated as a unit to one or more target accounts. Replication groups provide read-only access for the replicated objects.
A
failover group
is a replication group that can also fail over. A secondary failover group in a target account provides read-only access for the replicated objects. When a secondary failover group is promoted to become the primary failover group, read-write access is available. You can promote any target account specified in the list of allowed accounts in a failover group to serve as the primary failover group.
Replication and failover groups provide point-in-time consistency for the objects on the target account. The objects that can be included in a replication or failover group are listed below in
Replicated objects
.

Database replication
¶
Snowflake account replication supports replicating databases. Replication for a database includes the objects contained in that
database. The refresh operation for a database includes changes to the objects and data since the previous refresh for that database.
If
roles
are replicated (in the same or different replication or failover group), the database refresh also synchronizes the
privilege grants on the secondary database and the objects in the database (schemas, tables, views, etc.) to roles in the account.
Refer to
Grants for database objects
for more details.
Replication of some databases is not supported or might fail the refresh operation. For more information, see
Current limitations of replication
.
Replicated database objects
¶
When a primary database is replicated, a snapshot of its database objects and data is transferred to the secondary database. However,
some database objects are not replicated. The following table indicates which database objects are replicated to a secondary database.
For specific usage information about these objects, see
Replication considerations
.
Note
Objects that are
not
supported for replication are skipped during replication and won’t be available in the target account post failover.

Database replication and encryption
¶
Snowflake protects metadata and data sets at rest and in transit between the source and target accounts. The account
master key
(AMK) encrypts the key hierarchy within the account as shown in the
hierarchical key model
. Snowflake encrypts replicated data in the target account using the
account master key and the key hierarchy in the target account, regardless of whether you enable Tri-Secret Secure in the target account.
When you enable Tri-Secret Secure in the target account, Snowflake uses the composite master key and the corresponding key hierarchy in
the target account to encrypt the data. Note that target accounts do not have Tri-Secret Secure enabled by default; you must enable this
feature.
For more information about data encryption in Snowflake, see
Understanding end-to-end encryption in Snowflake
.
External volume replication
¶
Preview Feature
— Open
Available to all accounts.
Standard & Business Critical Feature
Replication of external volumes to a replication group is available to all accounts.
Replication of external volumes to a failover group requires Business Critical Edition or later.
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Iceberg tables rely on external volumes, which are
account-level objects that require extra configuration to connect to your external cloud storage. Before you can replicate an Iceberg table,
you must configure replication for external volumes. Account replication supports the replication of external volumes. For more
information about replicating external volumes and Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables, see
Configure replication for Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg™ tables
.
For more information about external volumes, see
External volume
.
Integration replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Account replication supports the replication of integrations for the following features:
Security integrations of the following types:
Federated Authentication & SSO (i.e. SAML2)
SCIM
Snowflake OAuth
External OAuth
For more information about security integrations, see
Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
.
API integrations.
After replicating API integrations to a target account, you must grant access to the remote service to the replicated
external functions. For more information, see
Updating the remote service for API integrations
.
Notification integrations of the following types:
TYPE = EMAIL
TYPE = QUEUE with DIRECTION = OUTBOUND
TYPE = WEBHOOK
Storage integrations.
When you replicate a storage integration, you must establish a new trust relationship for your cloud storage in the target
accounts. To learn more, see
Configure cloud storage access for secondary storage integrations
.
External access integrations.
For more information about external access integrations, see
External network access overview
.
Network policy replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
The feature supports replicating network policies.
For more information, see
Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
.
Parameter replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
This feature supports replicating account-level parameters and object parameters. Object parameters are replicated when the object is
included in the replication group. For example, if
WAREHOUSES
are replicated, warehouse-specific parameters
(e.g.
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS
) are replicated. For a full list, see
Object parameters
.
Account-level parameter replication includes all
Account parameters
and
parameters set on the account
.
Account-level parameters (e.g.
DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS
) are replicated when
ACCOUNT
PARAMETERS
is included in
the list of object types for a replication group.
Resource monitor replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
This feature supports replicating resource monitors and privileges granted on resource monitors to roles. A secondary resource monitor
follows the same quota reset schedule as its primary. For example, if the quota on the primary resource monitor resets on the first of the
month, and the secondary is first replicated on the 15th of the month, its quota will reset on the first of the next month along with the
primary.
Replication of resource monitor email notification settings
¶
Email notification settings for resource monitors are not included with resource monitor replication. Email notifications for
non-administrator users can be replicated with resource monitors. However, account administrator notification settings are
currently not replicated:
If
users
and
resource
monitors
are included in the
object_types
list for the replication or failover group,
notification settings for non-administrator users are replicated:
The
notify_users
list for a warehouse-level resource monitor is replicated to target accounts.
Email notifications for non-administrator users
are sent
on the target account.
If
resource
monitors
is included in the
object_types
list for the replication or failover group, but
users
is not included, the
notify_users
list for a secondary warehouse-level resource monitor is empty.
Account administrator notification settings are
not
replicated:
An account administrator must
enable email notifications
in each account using the web interface.
Resource monitor notifications are sent to account administrators if they have enabled email notifications in the source and/or
target accounts.
Role replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
This feature supports replicating roles, including role hierarchies. Role objects must be replicated to replicate access privileges.
Replicated access privileges are listed in
Replication of roles and grants
below.
Note
All roles are replicated.
Share replication
¶
This feature supports replication of share objects as well as access privileges granted to shares on database objects.
Replication of
inbound shares
(shares from providers) is
not
supported.
Backup replication for database, schema, and table backups
¶
The Snowflake
backups
feature lets you encapsulate a series of backups for a specific database,
schema, or table inside an object known as a backup set. You can optionally control the schedule of automatic backups and
automatic deletion of backups after an expiry period by applying a backup policy to the backup set. Backup sets and
backup policies are database-level objects. Snowflake replicates those objects along with the databases and schemas that contain them.
For information about how Snowflake replicates backup sets and backup policies, see
Replicate backup-related objects
.
User replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
This feature supports replicating users and their properties to target accounts, the following user authentication methods, and provisioning
users and groups with SCIM:
Authentication Method
Works in Target Accounts
Notes
Password
✔
Password with MFA (multi-factor authentication)
✔
Users who are enrolled in MFA in the source account must separately enroll in MFA when they log in to each target account.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
✔
Users who are enrolled in MFA in the source account must separately enroll in MFA when they log in to each target account.
Key-pair authentication
✔
Programmatic access tokens
✔
Programmatic access tokens are replicated to the target account only if users and roles are replicated.
Federated Authentication
✔
Refer to
Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
for details on replicating federated SSO (i.e. SAML2) security integrations.
Snowflake OAuth
✔
Refer to
Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
for details on replicating OAuth security integrations.
External OAuth
✔
Refer to
Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
for details on replicating OAuth security integrations.
SCIM
✔
Refer to
Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
for details on replicating SCIM security integrations.
Note
If
USERS
and
ROLES
objects are replicated to a target account, these object types are read-only in the target account
and cannot be modified. Users and roles must be created in the source account, then replicated to each target account. Refer to
Replication and read-only secondary objects
.
Warehouse replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
This feature supports replicating warehouses and privileges granted on warehouses to roles (if
roles
are replicated).
The state of the primary warehouse is not replicated. Warehouses are replicated in the suspended state to each target account
and can be resumed in the target account.
Workspace replication
¶
Preview Feature
— Open
Available to all accounts.
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Shared workspaces
are replicated when they are included in a database that is part of a
replication or failover group. Private workspaces are replicated when their owning users are replicated. In secondary (target) accounts,
replicated content is read-only; Workspace files (including SQL files, Notebook files, and so on) are executable but cannot be edited.
Dataset replication
¶
Account replication supports replicating Datasets. Datasets are materialized data objects that you use with Snowflake ML.
For usage information, see
Snowflake Datasets
.
Replication is supported for Datasets created starting with the General Availability of the Dataset replication feature.
For the release announcement, see
Mar 20, 2025: Snowflake Datasets (General availability)
.
Cortex Search Service replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
The feature supports replicating Cortex Search Services.
For more information, see
Replicate a Cortex Search Service
.
Replication of roles and grants
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
In order to replicate grants on objects to roles, roles must be replicated from the source account to the target account. To
replicate roles in a replication or failover group, you must include
roles
in the
object_types
list. Roles can be in a
separate replication or failover group from the data objects on which the privileges are granted.
When
roles
are replicated, grants on objects are
only
replicated to a target account if:
The privilege was granted by the owner of the object or indirectly by a role that was granted the privilege with the
WITH GRANT OPTION
parameter by the owner of the object.
Both the grantee and grantor role for a privilege grant are located in the target account.
The object is replicated (i.e. the object type is included in the
object_types
list).
Otherwise the grant on the object is not replicated.
For information about replicating secondary roles and session policies, see
Session policies with secondary roles
.
Note
If a role is dropped that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on an active pipe in the target account, the refresh operation
fails.
Privileges on replication groups and failover groups are
not
replicated. If the REPLICATE or FAILOVER privilege has been granted on replication groups or failover groups, these
privileges need to be granted in both the source
and
target accounts. Refer to
Replication privileges
for details on these privileges.
Grants for database objects
¶
If
roles
and
databases
are replicated to a target account (in the same or different replication or
failover group), refreshing a secondary database synchronizes the privilege grants on the database and the objects in the database
(schemas, tables, views, etc.) to existing roles in the target account (i.e. roles that have been replicated to the target account).
Note that only privilege grants on objects supported by database replication are synchronized. For the list of supported objects,
see
Replicated database objects
.
External tables are not currently supported for replication. As a result, privilege grants on external tables are
also not replicated.
Future grants for objects
¶
If roles are replicated to the target account,
future grants
that are granted at the
database or schema level are replicated to the target account. This also includes future grants on non-replication supported objects. For
example, external table replication is not yet supported, however future grants on external tables are replicated.
When you create an external table in a target account, the privileges granted on future external tables materialize as intended.
Object creation and ownership
¶
If new objects are created in a target account during a refresh from the source account, and roles are not replicated to the target
account, the OWNERSHIP privilege for the new objects is granted to the GLOBALORGADMIN role.
If roles are replicated to the target account, the OWNERSHIP privilege is granted to the same role on the target account as the
role with the OWNERSHIP privilege in the source account when roles are next replicated. The roles may be replicated at the same
time the new objects are created in the target account if the objects and roles are in the same replication (or failover) group.
Grants for shares
¶
In order to enable secure data sharing, grants on objects to shares are replicated even if
roles
are not
replicated to target accounts. This section provides information on how grants on objects to shares are replicated.
If
roles
are replicated from the source account to the target account, grants to objects on shares are replicated if:
The grantor role exists in the target account
or
The grantor role in the source account has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the primary object.
If
roles
are not replicated from the source account to the target account, then:
Grants on objects to shares are replicated.
The grantor role for grants on replicated objects to shares is the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the object.
User who refreshes objects in a target account
¶
A user who executes the
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP … REFRESH
command to refresh objects in a target account
from the source account must use a role with the REPLICATE privilege on the failover group. Snowflake protects this user in the target account
by failing in the following scenarios:
If the user does not exist in the source account, the refresh operation fails.
If the user exists in the source account, but a role with the REPLICATE privilege was not granted to the user, the refresh operation fails.
Replication schedule
¶
As a best practice, Snowflake recommends scheduling automatic refreshes using the REPLICATION_SCHEDULE parameter. The schedule can be
defined when creating a new replication or failover group with CREATE
<object>
or later (using ALTER
<object>
).
When you create a secondary replication or failover group, Snowflake automatically executes an initial refresh. The next refresh is
scheduled based on when the prior refresh started and the scheduling interval, or the next valid time based on the cron expression. For
example, if the refresh schedule interval is 10 minutes and the prior refresh operation (either a scheduled refresh or manually triggered
refresh) starts at 12:01, the next refresh is scheduled for 12:11.
Snowflake ensures only one refresh is executed at any given time. If a refresh is still executing when the next refresh is scheduled, the
next refresh is delayed to start when the currently executing refresh completes. For example, if a refresh is scheduled to execute 15
minutes after the hour, every hour, and the prior refresh completes at 12:16, the next refresh is scheduled to execute when the previously
executing refresh is completed.
Note
Automatically scheduled refresh operations are executed using the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the replication
or failover group. If a scheduled refresh operation fails due to insufficient privileges, grant the required privileges
to the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group.
Suspend and resume scheduled replication
¶
A secondary failover group cannot be promoted to the primary group while a refresh is executing. To fail over gracefully, suspend scheduled
replication in the target account. After the failover is completed, resume the scheduled replication. For more information,
see
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP
.
Replication to accounts on lower editions
¶
If either of the following conditions is true, Snowflake displays an error message:
A primary replication group with only database and/or share objects is in a Business Critical (or higher) account but one
or more of the accounts approved for replication are on lower editions. Business Critical Edition is intended for Snowflake
accounts with extremely sensitive data.
A primary replication or failover group with any
object types
is in a
Business Critical (or higher) account and a signed business associate agreement is in place to store PHI data in the account per HIPAA
and
HITRUST CSF
regulations. However, no such agreement is in place for one or more of the accounts
enabled for replication, regardless if they are Business Critical (or higher) accounts.
This behavior is implemented in an effort to help prevent account administrators for Business Critical (or higher) accounts from
inadvertently replicating sensitive data to accounts on lower editions.
An account administrator (a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) or a user with a role with the
CREATE REPLICATION GROUP/CREATE FAILOVER GROUP or OWNERSHIP privilege can override this default behavior by including the
IGNORE EDITION CHECK clause when executing the CREATE
<object>
or ALTER
<object>
statement. If IGNORE EDITION CHECK is set, the primary replication or failover group may be replicated to the specified accounts on
lower Snowflake editions in these specific scenarios.
Note
Failover groups can only be created in a Business Critical Edition (or higher) account. Therefore failover groups can
only
be
replicated to an account that is a Business Critical Edition (or higher) account.
Current limitations of replication
¶
Databases created from shares cannot be replicated.
Refresh operations fail if the primary database includes a stream with an unsupported source object.
The operation also fails if the source object for any stream has been dropped.
Append-only streams are not supported on replicated source objects.
Note
Database replication does not work for task graphs if the graph is owned by a different role than the role that performs replication.
