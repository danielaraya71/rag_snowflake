Monitoring replication and failover
¶
Standard & Business Critical Feature
Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support

This topic provides information on how to monitor account replication progress, history, and costs.
Use Snowsight to monitor replication
¶
To monitor the replication progress and status for
replication and failover groups
in an
organization, use the
Replication
page in Snowsight.
You can view the status and details of refresh operations, including:
Current status of the most recent refresh operation.
Replica lag time (time since the last refresh operation).
Distribution of replica lag times across groups.
Date and time of the next scheduled refresh operation.
Note
Snowsight lists the replication and failover groups for which your role has the MONITOR, OWNERSHIP, or REPLICATE privilege on.
Refresh operation details are only available to users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role or the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group.
You must be signed in to the source or target account to view refresh operation details. If you are not, you will be prompted to sign in.
Both the source account and the target account must use the same connection type (public internet). Otherwise, signing in to
the target account fails.
Currently, if your account uses private connectivity, you can’t use Snowsight to create or modify groups or connection
objects. However, you can use Snowsight to monitor groups that were created using SQL.
To view the replication status of each replication or failover group, complete the following steps:
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Replication
and then select
Groups
.
The
Groups
page displays
refresh operation details
for all the groups for which your
role has a privilege to view. You can use the tiles to filter the view.
For example, if the
Status
tile indicates there are failed refresh operations, you can select the tile to investigate the group(s)
with failures.
The lag time in the
Longest Replication lag
tile refers to the duration of time since the last refresh operation. This is the
length of time that the secondary replication or failover group
lags
behind the primary group. The longest lag time is the
length of time since the oldest secondary replication group was last refreshed.
For example, if you have three failover groups,
fg_1
,
fg_2
,
fg_3
, with independent replication schedules of
10 minutes, 2 hours, and 12 hours respectively, the longest lag time could be as long as 12 hours. If
fg_3
, however, was
recently refreshed in the target account, its lag time resets to 0 and a different failover group could have a longer lag time.
You can select an individual bar in the
Group Lag Distribution
tile to filter the results to an individual group.
You can also filter groups by using the search field or the dropdown menus:
You can search by replication or failover group name using the
(search) box.
Choose
Type
to filter the results by replication or failover group.
Choose
Replicating
to filter by primary (select
To
) or secondary groups (select
From
).
Choose the
(accounts) menu to filter the results by account name.
Choose
Status
to filter results by refresh operation status:
Refresh Cancelled
Refresh Failed
Refresh In Progress
Refresh Successful
You can see the following details about your replication and failover groups:
Column
Description
Name
Name of the replication or failover group.
Is Replicating
Indicates if the group is being replicated
to
a target account or
from
a source account.
If this column contains
destinations available
, there are no secondary replication or failover groups.
The number of destinations available indicates the number of target accounts the primary group can be replicated to.
Status
Displays the status of the latest refresh operation.
You must be signed in to the source or target account in order to access replication details.
If you are not signed in, select
Sign in
to view refresh operation status for the secondary group.
Both the source account and the target account must use the same connection type (public internet). Otherwise, signing in
to the target account fails.
Replication Lag
The length of time since the last refresh operation. This is the length of time that the secondary replication group “lags” behind
the primary replication group.
Next Refresh
The date and time of the next scheduled refresh operation.
You can select a replication or failover group to view detailed information about each refresh operation. For more information, see
the section on replication history in Snowsight
.
Monitor the progress of refresh operations
¶
This section provides information on how to monitor replication progress for a specific replication or failover group using either
Snowsight or SQL.

the section on replication history in Snowsight
.
Use SQL to monitor the progress of refresh operations
¶
To monitor the progress of a replication or failover group refresh, query the
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS, REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS_BY_JOB, REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS_ALL
table function (in the
Snowflake Information Schema
).
Example
¶
View the progress of the most recent refresh operation for the failover group
myfg
:
SELECT
phase_name
,
start_time
,
end_time
,

View replication history
¶
You can view replication history using Snowsight or using
SQL
.
Note
You can view the replication history for the replication and failover groups for which your role has the MONITOR, OWNERSHIP, or
REPLICATE privilege on.
Use Snowsight to view replication history
¶
You can view the replication history and details for each refresh operation for a specific replication or failover group in the details
page for the group.
Sign in to
Snowsight

Use SQL to view replication history
¶
To view the replication history of a specific replication or failover group within a specified date range, query one of the following:
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY, REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY_ALL
table function (in the
Snowflake Information Schema
).
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY view
(in
Account Usage
).
Examples
¶
Query the Information Schema REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY table function to view the account replication history of failover
group
myfg
in the last 7 days:
SELECT
PHASE_NAME
,
START_TIME
,
END_TIME
,
TOTAL_BYTES
,
OBJECT_COUNT
FROM
TABLE
(
information_schema
.
replication_group_refresh_history
(
'myfg'
))
WHERE
START_TIME
>=
CURRENT_DATE
()
-
INTERVAL
'7 days'
;
Copy
Query the Account Usage REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY view to view the account replication history in the current month:
SELECT
REPLICATION_GROUP_NAME
,
PHASE_NAME
,
START_TIME
,
END_TIME
,
TOTAL_BYTES
,
OBJECT_COUNT
FROM
snowflake
.
account_usage
.
replication_group_refresh_history
WHERE
START_TIME
>=
DATE_TRUNC
(
'month'
,
CURRENT_DATE
());
Copy
Monitor replication costs
¶
To monitor credit usage for replication, query one of the following:
REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY view
(in
Account Usage
).
REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY
table function (in the
Snowflake Information Schema
).
Examples
¶
Query the REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY table function to view credits used for account replication in the last 7 days:
SELECT
start_time
,
end_time
,
replication_group_name
,
credits_used
,
bytes_transferred
FROM
TABLE
(
information_schema
.
replication_group_usage_history
(
date_range_start
=>
DATEADD
(
'day'
,
-
7
,
CURRENT_DATE
())));
Copy
Query the Account Usage REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY view to view the credits used by replication or failover group for account
replication history in the current month:
SELECT
start_time
,
end_time
,
replication_group_name
,
credits_used
,
bytes_transferred
FROM
snowflake
.
account_usage
.
replication_group_usage_history
WHERE
start_time
>=
DATE_TRUNC
(
'month'
,
CURRENT_DATE
());
Copy
Monitor replication costs for databases
¶
The cost for replication for an individual database included in a replication or failover group can be calculated by retrieving the
number of copied bytes for the database and associating it with the credits used.
Examples
¶
Query Account Usage views
¶
The following examples calculate the costs for database replication in one replication group for the past 30 days.
Query the REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY Account Usage view and calculate the sum of the number of bytes replicated per database.
For example, to calculate the sum of the number of bytes replicated for databases in the replication group
myrg
in the last
30 days:
SELECT
SUM
(
value
:totalBytesToReplicate
)
as
sum_database_bytes
FROM
snowflake
.
account_usage
.
replication_group_refresh_history
rh
,
LATERAL
FLATTEN
(
input
=>
rh
.
total_bytes
:databases
)
WHERE
rh
.
replication_group_name
=
'MYRG'
AND
rh
.
start_time
>=
CURRENT_DATE
()
-
INTERVAL
'30 days'
;
Copy
Note the output of the sum of database bytes:
+--------------------+
| SUM_DATABASE_BYTES |
|--------------------|
|              22016 |
+--------------------+
Query the REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY Account Usage view and calculate the sum of the number of credits used and the sum
of the bytes transferred for replication.
For example, to calculate the sum of the number of credits used and the sum of the bytes transferred for replication of the
replication group
myrg
in the last 30 days:
SELECT
SUM
(
credits_used
)
AS
credits_used
,
SUM
(
bytes_transferred
)
AS
bytes_transferred
FROM
snowflake
.
account_usage
.
replication_group_usage_history
WHERE
replication_group_name
=
'MYRG'
AND
start_time
>=
CURRENT_DATE
()
-
INTERVAL
'30 days'
;
Copy
Note the output of the sum of the credits used and the sum of bytes transferred:
+--------------+-------------------+
| CREDITS_USED | BYTES_TRANSFERRED |
|--------------+-------------------|
|  1.357923604 |             22013 |
+--------------+-------------------+
Calculate the replication costs for databases using the values of the bytes transferred for databases, sum of the credits used, and
the sum of all bytes transferred for replication from the previous two steps:
(<database_bytes_transferred>
/
<bytes_transferred>)
*
<credits_used>
For example:
(22016
/
22013)
*
1.357923604
=
1.35810866)
Query Information Schema table functions
¶
For refresh operations within the past 14 days, query the associated Information Schema table functions.
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY, REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY_ALL
REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY
Query the REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_HISTORY table function to view the sum of the number of bytes copied for database replication
for the replication group
myrg
:
SELECT
SUM
(
value
:totalBytesToReplicate
)
FROM
TABLE
(
information_schema
.
replication_group_refresh_history
(
'myrg'
))
AS
rh
,
LATERAL
FLATTEN
(
input
=>
total_bytes
:databases
)
WHERE
rh
.
phase_name
=
'COMPLETED'
AND
rh
.
start_time
>=
CURRENT_DATE
()
-
INTERVAL
'14 days'
