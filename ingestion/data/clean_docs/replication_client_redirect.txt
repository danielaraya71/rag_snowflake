Redirecting client connections
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Client Redirect enables redirecting your client connections to Snowflake accounts in different
regions
without changing the connection settings for your application.
You can use Client Redirect in combination with the
account replication
feature for business continuity
and disaster recovery. You can also use Client Redirect to minimize changes needed in your application
settings when migrating your account to another region or cloud platform.
Introduction to Client Redirect
¶
Client Redirect is implemented through a Snowflake
connection
object. The connection object stores a secure
connection URL
that you use
with a Snowflake client to connect to Snowflake.
The hostname in the connection URL is composed of your organization name and the connection object name in addition to a common domain name:
organization_name
-
connection_name
.snowflakecomputing.com
Note that this hostname does not specify the account to which you are connecting. An account administrator determines the account to use by
designating the connection in that account to serve as the
primary connection
. When you use the connection URL to connect to Snowflake,
you are connecting to the account that contains the primary connection.
If an outage occurs in a region or cloud platform and the outage affects the account with the primary connection, the administrator can
promote a connection in a different account in a different region or cloud platform to serve as the primary connection.
Through this outage, you can continue to use the same connection URL to connect to Snowflake. Snowflake resolves the connection URL to the
account with the newly promoted connection (the account outside of the region or cloud platform affected by the outage).
Note
The Snowflake accounts that store the primary and secondary connections must be hosted in different
regions
.
Client Redirect flow
¶
Complete the steps in
Configuring Client Redirect
(in this topic) to create a connection URL for client connections. This
includes creating a primary connection and linked secondary connection(s).
Update Snowflake clients to connect using the connection URL.
Using a connection URL
(in this topic) contains a list of
supported clients and connection details.
In the event of a service outage in the region where the primary connection is located, complete the steps in
Redirecting client connections
(in this topic) to update the connection URL to redirect to a secondary connection.
When the outage is resolved, complete the steps in
Redirecting client connections
to redirect client connections back to the
original primary connection.
The following diagrams illustrate the Client Redirect flow for two accounts in the same organization but different regions (
Region
A
and
Region
B
) on either the same or different cloud platforms.
The primary connection is in
Account
1
in
Region
A
. Snowflake clients using the connection URL connect to
Account
1
.
A service outage in
Region
A
results in failed client connections:
The connection in
Account
2
in
Region
B
is promoted to act as the primary connection. Snowflake clients using the connection URL
now connect to
Account
2
.
Example
¶
The following SQL statements go through the client redirect workflow. Each step is explained in detail in the sections that follow in this
topic.
Normal client connections: Configure Client Redirect
¶
Create a primary connection in the source account
¶
Create a new primary connection and enable failover to other accounts in your organization. Each account that is enabled for failover
must be in a different region than the account with the primary connection.
Note the
account_name
column in the output of
SHOW REPLICATION ACCOUNTS
for each account to be
enabled for failover.
Execute the following statements in the
source
account:
-- Create a new primary connection
CREATE
CONNECTION
myconnection
;
-- View accounts in your organization that are enabled for replication
SHOW
REPLICATION
ACCOUNTS
;
-- Configure failover accounts for the primary connection
ALTER
CONNECTION

.
myaccount2
,
myorg
.
myaccount3
;
-- View the details for the connection
SHOW
CONNECTIONS
;
Copy
If private connectivity to the Snowflake service is enabled for your Snowflake account, you must create
and manage a DNS CNAME record for your connection URL. For more details, see
Configuring the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
.
Executed on target account
¶
Create a secondary connection linked to the primary connection. The name of the secondary connection must be the same name as the primary
connection.
CREATE
CONNECTION
myconnection
AS
REPLICA
OF
myorg
.
myaccount1
.
myconnection
;
Copy
If private connectivity to the Snowflake service is enabled for your Snowflake account, you must create
or update a DNS CNAME record for your connection URL. For more details, see
Modifying the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
.
Outage occurs in source region: Failover
¶
If an outage occurs in the region where the primary connection is located, promote a secondary connection in a different region
to serve as the primary connection.
Executed on target account
¶
Sign in to the target account that you want to promote to serve as the new source account.
Promote the secondary connection to serve as the primary connection:
ALTER
CONNECTION
myconnection
PRIMARY
;
Copy
If private connectivity to the Snowflake service is enabled for your Snowflake account, you must create
or update a DNS CNAME record for your connection URL. For more details, see
Modifying the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
.
Outage resolved: Failback
¶
Once the outage is resolved, promote the original primary connection to serve as the primary connection again.
Executed on the target account that previously served as the source account
¶
Sign in to the target account that served as the source account prior to the outage.
Promote the secondary connection back to primary connection:
ALTER
CONNECTION
myconnection
PRIMARY
;
Copy
If private connectivity to the Snowflake service is enabled for your Snowflake account, you must create
or update a DNS CNAME record for your connection URL. For more details, see
Modifying the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
.
Configuring Client Redirect
¶
This section describes how to create a primary connection and one or more secondary connections in a connection group.
Prerequisite
¶
To enable the Client Redirect feature for your accounts, an
organization administrator
must enable
replication for two or more accounts. To enable replication, see
Prerequisite: Enable replication for accounts in the organization
for detailed instructions.
Create a primary connection
¶
Important
Snowflake assigned your organization a unique, generated name when it was created in the system. The organization name is a part of the
connection URL defined in a connection object and submitted by Snowflake clients to access an account. Before you create any connection
objects, verify that your organization name in Snowflake is satisfactory. To change your organization name in the system, contact
Snowflake Support
.
You can create a primary connection in the source account using Snowsight or
SQL
.
Create a primary and secondary connection using Snowsight
¶
To create a connection using Snowsight, complete the following steps:
Note
Only a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a connection using Snowsight.
You must be signed in to the target account as a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role. If not, you will be prompted to sign in.
Currently, if your account uses private connectivity, you can’t use Snowsight to create a primary and secondary
connection.
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Client Redirect
.
Select
+ Connection
.
Select
Target Account
.
In the
Connection Name
box, enter a connection name that meets the following requirements:
Must start with an alphabetic character and may only contain letters, decimal digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
Must be unique across connection names and account names in the organization.
Select
Create Connection
.
Create a primary connection using SQL
¶
Note
Only a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can execute the SQL commands in this section.
Create a new primary connection using the
CREATE CONNECTION
command. The name of each primary
connection must be unique across all connection and account names in the organization.
The connection name is included as part of the connection URL used to connect to Snowflake accounts.
For example, to create a connection named
myconnection
:
CREATE
CONNECTION
myconnection
;
Copy
Modify this primary connection using an
ALTER CONNECTION … ENABLE FAILOVER TO ACCOUNTS
statement. Provide a comma-separated list of accounts in your organization that can store a failover option for this connection (i.e. a
secondary connection).
Any account that stores a secondary connection must be hosted in a region different from the account that stores the primary connection.
Client Redirect only operates successfully across regions. For example, if you try to redirect client connections from
account1
to
account2
in the same region, client redirect does not work.
To see the complete list of accounts in your organization that are enabled for replication, execute
SHOW REPLICATION ACCOUNTS
.
For example, allow accounts
myaccount2
and
myaccount3
in the
myorg
organization to each store a secondary connection for the
myconnection
connection:
ALTER
CONNECTION
myconnection
ENABLE
FAILOVER
TO
ACCOUNTS
myorg
.
myaccount2
,
myorg
.
myaccount3
;
Copy
Execute the
SHOW CONNECTIONS
command to view the details for the connection.

Create a secondary connection in each target account
¶
Create a secondary connection in one or more accounts, linked to a primary connection using
CREATE CONNECTION … AS REPLICA OF
. Note that you can only create a secondary connection in
an account specified in the ALTER CONNECTION … ENABLE FAILOVER TO ACCOUNTS statement in
Create a Primary Connection
.
Execute a CREATE CONNECTION … AS REPLICA OF statement in each target account to create a replica of the specified primary connection.
Important
Each secondary connection
must
have the same name as its primary connection. The connection name is included in the connection
URL.
Execute the SQL statements in this section in the
target
account where you want to create a secondary connection.
Note
Only a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can execute the SQL commands in this section.
Execute the SHOW CONNECTIONS command to view all connections. Copy the value of the
primary
column for the primary connection.
You will use this value when creating the secondary connection in the next step.

Grant the FAILOVER Privilege to a Role —
Optional
¶
An account administrator can grant the FAILOVER privilege on a connection object to an account role.
This enables a user other than the account administrator to promote a secondary connection to serve as the primary connection.
For example, to grant the role
my_failover_role
the ability to fail over the connection
myconnection
, execute
the following statement on the
target
account:
GRANT
FAILOVER
ON
CONNECTION
myconnection
TO
ROLE
my_failover_role
;
Copy
A user with the role
my_failover_role
can now promote the secondary connection
myconnection
to serve as
primary connection in the case of failover:
USE
ROLE
my_failover_role
;
ALTER
CONNECTION
myconnection
PRIMARY
;
Copy

Configuring the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
¶
If private connectivity to the Snowflake service is enabled for your Snowflake account, then your network administrator must create and
manage a DNS record for your connection URL. Your network administrator can use a CNAME record, alias record, or an alias based on the
configuration of the network architecture. For consistency, the following example uses a CNAME record.
These steps use AWS PrivateLink as an example, and the steps are the same if your Snowflake account uses Azure Private Link or Google Cloud
Private Service Connect:
Execute SHOW CONNECTIONS in one of your accounts in which client redirect is enabled. For example, suppose AWS PrivateLink is enabled
for
myaccount1
and
myaccount2
.

Note that the output of this command in the CONNECTION_URL column should match the
privatelink-connection-urls
list when calling
the
SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG
function in either
myaccount1
or
myaccount2
. This list already
contains the connection URL formatted with the
privatelink
segment (as shown in the next step). You can optionally run the command
in this step or call the function. If calling the function, use the URLs as is without any further modification.
Record the CONNECTION_URL column value, and create two URLs to support private connectivity and
OCSP
.
Add a
privatelink
segment to the URL just before
snowflakecomputing.com
(
myorg-myconnection.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
, in this example).
Add an
ocsp
segment to the beginning of the URL (
ocsp.myorg-myconnection.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
, in this example).
Using a tool provided by your DNS provider, create a CNAME record for the connection URL and the OCSP URL:
Set the domain (or alias) using the modified CONNECTION_URL column value.
Configure the record to have the connection URL resolve to the primary Snowflake account URL. Be sure to include all URL segments for
the cloud region and AWS PrivateLink based on the URL format that you choose. This is the primary account URL and it is where client
connections to the connection URL will redirect.
Configure the record to have the OCSP URL resolve to either the private endpoint IP address for an account on Azure or the private
endpoint ID value for an account on AWS.
In the case of failover, you must manually update the DNS setting to have the connection URL point to the secondary account URL as
shown in
Modifying the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
. Similarly, you must update your OCSP settings to point to the private endpoint IP
address or private endpoint ID value.
For example:
myaccount1.us-west-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com.
ocsp.myaccount1.us-west-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com.
Copy
Alternatively, use the organization and account name URL.
For example:
myorg-myaccount1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com.
ocsp.myorg-myaccount1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com.
Copy
Note the trailing period, which must be included.
Users connect to Snowflake using the following connection URL format:
organization_name
-
connection_name
.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
Where:
organization_name
Name of your Snowflake organization. The Snowflake accounts that your users connect to are contained in this organization.
connection_name
Name of the connection object.

Configuring Client Redirect and reader accounts
¶
If you are a data provider with
reader accounts
, you can use Client Redirect
to provide continued access to shared data in the event of a service outage. The configuration steps for creating connections are
the same as those described in the
Configuring Client Redirect
section for source and target reader accounts:
Create two reader accounts. Each reader account must be in a different region.
Create a primary connection
in the source reader account. Enable failover to the other reader account.
Create a secondary connection in each target account
in the reader account that you enabled for failover from the source account.
Share the connection URL with your data consumers.
If a service outage occurs,
redirect client connections
. Data consumers using the
connection URL to connect to your reader account now connect to the newly promoted source reader account.
Using a connection URL
¶
This section provides instructions for referencing a connection URL in the configuration for various Snowflake clients.

Authentication and Client Redirect
¶
Users must be provisioned in the source account and on each target account if security integrations are not
replicated
.
Federated authentication & SSO
¶
Configure federated authentication separately in each target account. Provide the identity provider (IdP) details using the setup
options in
Configuring Snowflake to use federated authentication
:
Note
Snowflake recommends configuring your SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider (IdP) with the connection URL rather than an account URL so
users are redirected to the correct account in case of failover.
OAuth
¶
Configure a security integration object for OAuth in each target account. The security integration object must be identical to the same
object in the source account. For instructions, see the appropriate topic:
Snowflake OAuth
External OAuth
To retrieve security integration properties, query the
DESCRIBE INTEGRATION
command for each security integration
in the source account. Then recreate each security integration in a target account by executing the
CREATE INTEGRATION
command.
OAuth redirect behavior
¶
If you are using Snowflake OAuth for authenticating a client connection and are connecting to Snowflake using a connection URL, you
are prompted to re-authenticate if the connection URL is redirected to another account (e.g. in case of failover). Snowflake OAuth
tokens are valid for use in a specific account. When a connection URL is updated to point to an account in a different region, the
existing OAuth token becomes invalid.
In the case of a failover, when the connection URL is updated to the new account, the client will disconnect with an
invalid
OAuth
access
token
error. You must re-authenticate and consent to permissions to re-establish the connection.
Note
You will
not
be prompted for re-authentication when the connection URL is updated to a new account if the
OAuth security integration is replicated
to that account. For more
information, refer to
Replicating OAuth security integrations
.
Redirecting client connections
¶
In the event of a service outage in the region where the primary connection is located, redirect the client connection to an account that
stores a secondary connection.
Promoting a secondary connection to serve as the primary connection
¶
Initiating the redirect involves promoting a secondary connection in an available region to serve as the primary connection using
ALTER CONNECTION
. Concurrently, the former primary connection becomes a secondary connection.
Sign in to the target account in an available region that contains the secondary connection to be promoted to serve
as the primary connection.
Execute the SQL statements in this section:
View all connections in the account:
SHOW
CONNECTIONS
;
Copy
The statement returns the following output:
+--------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

Modifying the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
¶
To redirect client connections to a secondary account, your network administrator must modify the DNS setting created in
Configuring the DNS settings for private connectivity to the Snowflake service
.
Using a tool provided by your DNS provider, modify the DNS setting for the connection URL.
Set the destination hostname as the complete Snowflake account URL for the account that stores your new primary connection, including the
additional segments that identify the region and cloud platform where your account is hosted and the support for AWS PrivateLink, Azure
Private Link, or Google Cloud Private Service Connect. This is the account name where client connections to the connection URL will now
redirect. Be sure to include the private connectivity OCSP URL when updating the DNS settings.
For example:
myaccount1.us-east-1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com.
ocsp.myaccount1.us-east-1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com.
Copy
(Note the trailing period, which must be included.)
Note
You can configure private connectivity and client redirect to work with Snowsight. Ensure your DNS updates include the Snowsight
values from the output of the SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG function. For details, refer to
private connectivity and Snowsight
.
Verifying the connection URL is updated
¶
To verify the connection URL has been updated, you can confirm the region of your current connection. Use the connection URL to connect to
Snowflake and execute the
CURRENT_REGION
function.
SELECT
CURRENT_REGION
();
Copy
Modifying a connection
¶
You can edit the target accounts for a connection after creating it using Snowsight or SQL.

Verify the connection URL used by your users
¶
Query the
LOGIN_HISTORY , LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER
family of table functions to view the login activity for your users within the last
7 days. The output indicates which users and Snowflake clients have been using a connection URL. The REPORTED_CLIENT_TYPE and
REPORTED_CLIENT_VERSION columns display the client and version used for each connection to Snowflake, and the CONNECTION column displays
the connection URL used, if any.
Note
If a client authenticates through an identity provider (IdP) that is configured with the account URL rather than the connection URL, the
IdP directs the client to the account URL after authentication is complete. The CONNECTION column for this login event is NULL. See
Authentication and Client Redirect
(in this topic).
For example, retrieve up to 100 login events of every user your current role is allowed to monitor in the last 72 hours:
SELECT
event_timestamp
,
user_name
,
client_ip
,
reported_client_type
,

Current limitations of Client Redirect
¶
Client connections using a connection URL and OAuth integration require re-authentication when the connection URL is updated to point to a
different account if the OAuth security integration is not replicated to that account. For more information, refer to
OAuth redirect behavior
.
Web browsers may take several minutes to redirect due to browser cache.
If you need to verify that the redirect works, you can connect to Snowflake with a
different client
.
Alternatively, open a new private browser window (e.g. incognito mode in Google Chrome) to avoid browser caching issues. Note that some web
browsers in private or incognito mode might still cache data. To avoid using the browser cache, close any open private browsers windows and
tabs before you open a new private browser window.
You can only add one target account using Snowsight. To add more than one target account to the list of allowed failover
accounts, use the
ALTER CONNECTION … ENABLE FAILOVER TO ACCOUNTS
command.
