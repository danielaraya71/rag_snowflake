Replicating databases and account objects across multiple accounts
¶
Standard & Business Critical Feature
Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
This topic describes the steps necessary to replicate account objects and data across Snowflake accounts in the same organization,
and keep the objects and data synchronized. Account replication can occur across Snowflake accounts in different
regions
and across
cloud platforms
.
Note
When you upgrade an account to Business Critical Edition (or higher), it might take up to 12 hours for failover capabilities
to become available.
Region support for replication and failover/failback
¶
Customers can replicate across all regions within a Region Group. To replicate between regions in different
Region groups
(for example, from a Snowflake commercial region to a Snowflake government region), please contact
Snowflake Support
to enable
access.
Transitioning from database replication to group-based replication
¶
Databases that have been enabled for replication using
ALTER DATABASE
must have replication
disabled
before
they can be added to a replication or failover group.
Note
Execute the SQL statements in this section using the ACCOUNTADMIN role.
Step 1. Disable replication for a replication enabled database
¶
Execute the
SYSTEM$DISABLE_DATABASE_REPLICATION
function to disable replication for a primary database,
along with any secondary databases linked to it, in order to add it to a replication or failover group.
Execute the following SQL statement from the source account with the primary database:
SELECT
SYSTEM$DISABLE_DATABASE_REPLICATION
(
'mydb'
);
Copy
Step 2. Add the database to a primary failover group and create a secondary failover group
¶
Once you have successfully disabled replication for a database, you can add the primary database to a failover group in the source account.
Then create a secondary failover group in the target account. When the secondary failover
group is refreshed in the target account, the previously secondary database will automatically be added as a member of the secondary
failover group and refreshed with the changes from the primary database.
For more details on creating primary and secondary failover groups, see
Workflow
.
Note
When you add a previously replicated database to a replication or failover group, Snowflake does
not
re-replicate the data that
has already been replicated for that database. Only changes since the last refresh are replicated when the group is refreshed.
Workflow
¶
The following SQL statements demonstrate the workflow for enabling account and database object replication and refreshing objects. Each step
is discussed in detail below.
Note
The following examples require replication be enabled for the source and target accounts. For details, see
Prerequisite: Enable replication for accounts in the organization
.
Examples
¶
Execute the following SQL statements in your preferred Snowflake client to enable account and database object replication and failover,
and refresh objects.
Executed on source account

Create a role and grant it the CREATE FAILOVER GROUP privilege. This step is
optional
:
USE
ROLE

;
Copy
Create a failover group in the source account and enable replication to specific target accounts.
Note
If you have databases to add to a replication or failover group that have been previously enabled for database replication and failover
using
ALTER DATABASE
, follow the
Transitioning from database replication to group-based replication
instructions (in this
topic) before adding them to a group.
To add a database to a failover group, the active role must have the MONITOR privilege on the database. For details
on database privileges, see
Database privileges
(in a separate topic).

Copy
Manually refresh the secondary failover group. This is an
optional
step. If the primary failover group is created with
a replication schedule, the initial refresh of the secondary failover group is automatically executed when the secondary
failover group is created.
Create a role with the REPLICATE privilege on the failover group. This step is
optional
.
Execute in the target account using a role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the failover group:
GRANT
REPLICATE
ON

;
Copy
Execute the refresh statement using a role with the REPLICATE privilege:
USE
ROLE

;
Copy
Create a role with the FAILOVER privilege on the failover group. This step is
optional
.
Execute in the target account using a role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the failover group:
GRANT
FAILOVER
ON
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
TO
ROLE
my_failover_role
;;
Copy
Replicating account objects and databases
¶
The instructions in this section explain how to prepare your accounts for replication, enable the replication of specific objects from the
source account to the target account, and synchronize the objects in the target account.
Important
Target accounts do not have Tri-Secret Secure or private connectivity to the Snowflake service, such as
AWS PrivateLink
, enabled by default. If you require Tri-Secret Secure or private
connectivity to the Snowflake service for compliance, security or other purposes, it is your responsibility to configure and enable
those features in the target account.
Prerequisite: Enable replication for accounts in the organization
¶
The organization administrator must enable replication for the source and target accounts.
To enable replication for accounts, an
organization administrator
uses the
SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER
function to set the
ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DATABASE_REPLICATION
parameter to
true
.
As an organization administrator
, enable replication for each source and target account in your organization.
-- View the list of the accounts in your organization
-- Note the organization name and account name for each account for which you are enabling replication
SHOW
ACCOUNTS
;
-- Enable replication by executing this statement for each source and target account in your organization
SELECT
SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER
(
'<organization_name>.<account_name>'
,
'ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DATABASE_REPLICATION'
,
'true'
);
Copy
Though the SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER function supports the legacy
account locator
identifier,
it causes unexpected results when an organization has multiple accounts that share the same locator (in different regions).
Step 1: Create a role with the CREATE FAILOVER GROUP privilege in the source account —
Optional
¶
Create a role and grant it the CREATE FAILOVER GROUP privilege. This step is optional. If you have already created this role, skip to
Step 3: Create a primary failover group in a source account
.
USE
ROLE
ACCOUNTADMIN
;
CREATE
ROLE
myrole
;
GRANT
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
ON
ACCOUNT
TO
ROLE

;
Copy
Step 2: Identify accounts enabled for replication and group membership
¶
Before creating a primary failover group, identify the accounts enabled for replication and the existing
failover and replication groups.
View all accounts enabled for replication
¶
To retrieve the list of accounts in your organization that are enabled for replication, use
SHOW REPLICATION ACCOUNTS
.
Execute the following SQL statement using the ACCOUNTADMIN role:
SHOW

View failover and replication group membership
¶
Account, database, and share objects have
constraints on group membership
. Before creating new
groups or adding objects to existing groups, you can review the list of existing failover groups and the objects in each group.
Note
Only an account administrator (user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) or the group owner (role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group) can
execute the SQL statements in this section.
View all failover groups linked to the current account, and the object types in each group:
SHOW FAILOVER GROUPS
;
Copy
View all the databases in failover group
myfg
:
SHOW DATABASES
IN

;
Copy
Step 3: Create a primary failover group in a source account
¶
Create a primary failover group and enable the replication and failover of specific objects from the current (source) account to one or more
target accounts in the same organization.
You can create a replication or failover group using
Snowsight
or
SQL
.
Create a replication or failover group using Snowsight
Create a failover group using SQL
Note
If you have databases to add to a replication or failover group that have been previously enabled for database replication
using
ALTER DATABASE
, follow the
Transitioning from database replication to group-based replication
instructions (in this
topic) before adding them to a group.
Create a replication or failover group using Snowsight
¶
Note
Only account administrators can create a replication or failover group using Snowsight (refer to
Limitations of using Snowsight for replication configuration
).
You must be signed in to the target account as a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role. If you are not, you will be
prompted to sign in.
Both the source account and the target account must use the same connection type (public internet). Otherwise, signing
in to the target account fails.
Complete the following steps to create a new replication or failover group:
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Replication
, then complete one of these actions on the
Groups
tab:
For Business Critical Edition (or higher) accounts, complete one of these actions:
If there are no replication groups or connections, select
Get started
to configure a replication group and
a connection. The
Setup business continuity
wizard appears.
Select
+ Group
to configure a replication group without configuring a connection. The
Create a group
wizard appears.
For Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition accounts, complete one of these actions:
If there are no replication groups or connections, select
Get started
to configure a replication group.
The
Setup replication
wizard appears.
If one or more replication groups exist, select
+ Group
to configure a replication group. The
Create a group
wizard appears.
On the
Select a target account
page, select a target account and sign into it, then select
Next
.
On the
Create a group
page, in the
Group name
box, enter a name for the group that meets the
following requirements:
Must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the identifier string is
enclosed in double quotes (for example, “My object”). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.
For more information, see
Identifier requirements
.
Must be unique across failover and replication groups in an account.
Choose
Edit objects
to add share and account objects to your group.
Note
Account objects can only be added to one replication or failover group. If a replication or failover group with any account
objects already exists in your account, you cannot select those objects.
Choose
Select databases
to add database objects to your group.
Select the
Replication frequency
.
If the account is Business Critical Edition or higher, a failover group is created by default. You can choose to create a replication group
instead. To create a replication group, select
Advanced options
, then unselect
Enable failover
.
Complete one of the following actions:
For Business Critical Edition (or higher) accounts, select
Next
.
For Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition accounts, select
Start replication
to create the replication group.
For Business Critical Edition (or higher) accounts, on the
Create connection
page, enter a connection name in
the
Connection name
box, then select
Start replication
.
If creating the replication group is unsuccessful, refer to
Troubleshoot issues with creating and editing replication groups using Snowsight
for common errors
and how to resolve them.
Create a failover group using SQL
¶
Create a failover group of specified account and database objects in the source account and enable replication and failover to a list of
target accounts. See
CREATE FAILOVER GROUP
for syntax.
For example, enable replication of users, roles, warehouses, resources monitors, and databases
db1
and
db2
from the source account
to the
myaccount2
account in the same organization. Set the replication schedule to automatically refresh
myaccount2
every 10
minutes.
Execute the following statement on the source account:
USE
ROLE
myrole
;
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
USERS
,
ROLES
,
WAREHOUSES
,
RESOURCE MONITORS
,
DATABASES
,
INTEGRATIONS
,
NETWORK POLICIES
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
db1
,
db2
ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES
=
API INTEGRATIONS
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2
REPLICATION_SCHEDULE
=
'10 MINUTE'
;
Copy
Step 4: Create a role with the CREATE FAILOVER GROUP privilege in the target account —
Optional
¶
Create a role in the target account and grant it the CREATE FAILOVER GROUP privilege. This step is optional. If you have already created
this role, skip to
Step 5: Create a secondary failover group in the target account
.
USE
ROLE
ACCOUNTADMIN
;
CREATE
ROLE
myrole
;
GRANT
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
ON
ACCOUNT
TO
ROLE
myrole
;
Copy
Step 5: Create a secondary failover group in the target account
¶
Note
If account objects (for example, users or roles) exist in the target account that do not exist in the source account, refer to
Initial replication of users and roles
before creating a secondary group.
Create a secondary failover group in the target account as a replica of the primary failover group in the source account.
Execute a
CREATE FAILOVER GROUP … AS REPLICA OF
statement in each target account for which you
enabled replication in
Step 3: Create a primary failover group in a source account
(in this topic).
Executed from each target account:
USE
ROLE
myrole
;
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
AS
REPLICA
OF
myorg
.
myaccount1
.
myfg
;
Copy
Step 6. Refresh a secondary failover group in the target account manually —
Optional
¶
To manually refresh the objects in a target account, execute the
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP … REFRESH
command.
As a best practice, we recommend scheduling your secondary refreshes by setting the REPLICATION_SCHEDULE parameter using
CREATE FAILOVER GROUP
or
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP
.
Note
If the user who calls the function in the target account was dropped in the source account, the refresh operation fails.
Grant the REPLICATE privilege on failover group to role —
Optional
¶
To execute the command to refresh a secondary replication or failover group in the target account, you must use a role with the
REPLICATE privilege on the failover group. The REPLICATE privilege is currently
not
replicated and must be granted on a
failover (or replication) group in both the source and target accounts.
Execute this statement from the source account using a role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group:
GRANT
REPLICATE
ON
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
TO
ROLE
my_replication_role
;
Copy
Execute this statement from the target account using a role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group:
GRANT
REPLICATE
ON
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
TO
ROLE
my_replication_role
;
Copy
Manually refresh a secondary failover group
¶
For example, to refresh the objects in the failover group
myfg
, execute the following statement from the target account:
USE
ROLE
my_replication_role
;
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
REFRESH
;
Copy
Step 7. Grant the FAILOVER privilege on failover group to role —
Optional
¶
To execute the command to fail over a secondary failover group in a target account, you must use a role with the
FAILOVER privilege
on the failover group. The FAILOVER privilege is currently
not
replicated and must be granted in each source and target account.
For more information, see
Replication of roles and grants
.
For example, to grant the FAILOVER privilege to role
my_failover_role
on failover group
my_fg
, execute the
following statement in the
target account
using a role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group:
GRANT
FAILOVER
ON
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
TO
ROLE
my_failover_role
;
Copy
For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see
Creating custom roles

Schema-level replication for failover groups
¶
For databases in failover groups, you can optionally configure the REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter on the database
and/or individual schemas in the database to specify a subset of schemas for replication.
This feature enables you to control the schemas in a failover group that are replicated, which is useful if only a subset of data
in a database needs the added disaster recovery protection provided by failover.
Because this parameter is enabled by default for all databases and the schemas they contain, you adjust the replication
granularity by choosing which databases and/or schemas to omit from replication. You can further fine-tune the
replication settings by allowing certain schemas to be replicated even though the database that contains them isn’t replicated.
Specify schemas to replicate or skip
¶
You can explicitly specify schemas to replicate or skip in a database in a failover group using the
optional
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
parameter.
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter
¶
The REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter specifies whether a schema that belongs to a database in a failover group is replicated.
This parameter can be set on a database and any/all schemas in the database. If the parameter is set for a database, all of the schemas
in the database inherit the value, unless a different value is explicitly set for any given schema.
The parameter accepts two values,
'YES'
or
'NO'
(case-insensitive), and is optional:
If REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS is not explicitly set on a database (or explicitly unset), the database follows the standard replication
behavior, which is equivalent to setting the parameter to
'YES'
.
If REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS is not explicitly set on a schema (or explicitly unset), the replication behavior is inherited from its
parent database.
ALTER
DATABASE
<name>
SET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
=
{
'YES'
|
'NO'
}
ALTER
DATABASE
<name>
UNSET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS

SET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
=
{
'YES'
|
'NO'
}
ALTER
SCHEMA
<name>
UNSET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
Copy
Security requirements
¶
To set or unset this parameter on a database or a schema, the following privileges are required:
REPLICATE (
account-level privilege
). Prior to the schema-level replication feature, this privilege was
only an object-level privilege on replication groups and failover groups.
Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can grant this privilege to other roles.
USAGE (
database
and
schema
privilege)
or any similar privileges that enable taking action on the database and schema.
Examples
¶
Grant necessary privileges on a pre-existing role,
replicationadmin
:
USE
ROLE
ACCOUNTADMIN
;
GRANT
REPLICATE
ON
ACCOUNT
TO
ROLE
replicationadmin
;
GRANT
USAGE
ON
DATABASE
db1
TO
ROLE
replicationadmin
;
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA

.
sch1
TO
ROLE
replicationadmin
;
Copy
Replicate only one schema,
sch1
, in the
db1
database:
USE
ROLE
replicationadmin
;
ALTER
DATABASE
db1
SET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
=
'NO'
;
ALTER
SCHEMA
sch1
SET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
=
'YES'
;
Copy
Replicate all schemas except one schema,
sch2
, in the
db2
database:
USE
ROLE
replicationadmin
;
ALTER
DATABASE
db2
SET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
=
'YES'
;
ALTER
SCHEMA
sch2
SET
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
=
'NO'
;
Copy
Refresh of schemas with REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS set in target accounts
¶
During a database refresh:
Schemas with REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS set to
'YES'
are replicated from the source account to the target account.
Schemas with REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS set to
'NO'
are not replicated, except in the following two scenarios:
The target schema is a replica of the source account schema. In this case, the target schema is always synchronized with its source schema.
The target schema has a name conflict with the source account schema. In this situation, the replication job fails due to the name
conflict.
List databases and schemas with REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS set in your account
¶
You can list the values set for the REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter in the current account
by querying the ACCOUNT_USAGE and INFORMATION_SCHEMA views.
Tip
If you aren’t familiar with why you might use the ACCOUNT_USAGE or INFORMATION_SCHEMA views,
see
Differences between Account Usage and Information Schema
.
Examples
¶
For these examples, we’ll use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. That way, you can see the settings immediately
after making any changes.
Using the pre-existing
replicationadmin
role, return all the parameter values for the account, which has two databases:
db1
database explicitly set to
NO
and
sch1
schema in the database explicitly set to
YES
. Only that
one schema in the database is eligible for replication.
db2
database explicitly set to
YES
and
sch2
schema in the database explicitly set to
NO
. All schemas
in the database are eligible for replication except for that one schema.

Apply global IDs to objects created by scripts in target accounts
¶
If you created account objects, for example, users and roles, in your target account by any means
other than
via replication (for example,
using scripts), these users and roles have no global identifier by default. The refresh operation uses global identifiers to synchronize
these objects to the same objects in the source account.
In most cases, when a target account is refreshed from the source account, the refresh operation
drops
any account objects of the
types in the
OBJECT_TYPES
list in the target account that have no global identifier. The initial replication of users and roles to
a target account, however, might cause the first refresh operation to fail. For details on this behavior, refer to
Initial replication of users and roles
.
Use SYSTEM$LINK_ACCOUNT_OBJECTS_BY_NAME() to apply global IDs
¶
You can prevent the loss of some object types by linking matching objects with the same name in the source and target accounts. The
SYSTEM$LINK_ACCOUNT_OBJECTS_BY_NAME function adds a global identifier to account objects in the target account.
Note
Global identifiers are only added to account objects that are included in a replication or failover group for the
following object types:
RESOURCE_MONITOR
ROLE
USER
WAREHOUSE
Apply global identifiers to account objects in the target account of the types included in the
object_types

Initial replication of users and roles
¶
The behavior of the initial refresh operation for USERS and ROLES object types can vary depending on whether or not there are matching
objects with the same name in the target account.
Note
The behavior described in this section applies only the
first
time these object types are replicated to the target account.
The scenarios below describe the replication of USERS. The same also applies to the replication of ROLES.
If there are existing users in the target account with the same name as users in the source account, the initial refresh operation
fails and describes the two options you have to continue:
Force the refresh operation and allow any existing users in the target account to be dropped. The users in the source account
will be replicated to the target account.
To force a refresh for a group, use the FORCE parameter for the refresh command. For example, to force the refresh of a failover
group, execute the following command:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
<
fg_name
>
REFRESH
FORCE
;
Copy
Link the account objects by name. The
SYSTEM$LINK_ACCOUNT_OBJECTS_BY_NAME
function links
users with the same name in both the target account and the source account. Users in the target account that are linked are
not deleted.
To link account objects by name, execute the following command:
SELECT
SYSTEM$LINK_ACCOUNT_OBJECTS_BY_NAME
(
'<rg_name>'
);
Copy
Note
Any user in the target account that
does not
have a matching user in the source account with the same name is
dropped
.
If there are
no
users in the target account with names matching users in the source account, the initial refresh operation in
the target account drops all users. This can result in the following data and metadata loss:
If USERS are included in the OBJECT_TYPES list for a replication or failover group:
Worksheets are lost.
Query history is lost.
If USERS are included in the OBJECT_TYPES list, but ROLES is not:
Privilege grants to users are lost.
If ROLES are included in the OBJECT_TYPES list:
Privilege grants to share objects are lost.
To avoid dropping users or roles in the target account:
In the source account, manually recreate any users or roles that exist
only
in the target account before the initial replication.
In the target account, link matching objects with the same name in both accounts using the
SYSTEM$LINK_ACCOUNT_OBJECTS_BY_NAME
function.
Configure cloud storage access for secondary storage integrations
¶
If you enable storage integration replication, you must take additional steps after the
storage integration is replicated to target accounts.
The replicated integration has its own identity and access management (IAM) entity that is different from the identity
and IAM entity of the primary integration. Therefore, you must update your cloud provider permissions
to grant the replicated integration access to your cloud storage.
You only need to configure this trust relationship on target accounts one time.
The process is similar to granting access in the source account.
See the following pages for more information:
Configuring a Snowflake storage integration to access Amazon S3
Configuring an integration for Google Cloud Storage
Configuring a Snowflake storage integration for Azure
Configure automated refresh for directory tables on secondary stages
¶
If you replicate an external stage with a directory table, and you have configured automated refresh for the source directory table,
you must take steps to configure
automated refresh
for the secondary directory table.
The process is similar to setting up automated refresh in your source account. See the following for more information:
Amazon S3: The configuration process depends on how you set up event notifications.
If you use Amazon S3 Event Notifications with Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS),
follow the instructions in
Step 2: Configure event notifications
.
You can also migrate from SQS to SNS. For more information, see
Migrate to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
.
If you use Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), see
Subscribing the Snowflake SQS Queue to your SNS topic
.
Google Cloud Storage: Create a new subscription to your Pub/Sub topic and a new notification integration in your target account.
Then, grant Snowflake access to the Pub/Sub subscription. For instructions,
see
Configuring Automation Using GCS Pub/Sub
.
Azure Blob Storage: Create a new Event Grid subscription and storage queue. Then, create a new notification integration in the
target account and grant Snowflake access to your storage queue. For instructions,
see
Configuring Automation With Azure Event Grid
.
Important
After you complete these configuration steps in your target account,
you should perform a full refresh of your directory table to ensure that it has not missed any notifications.
For Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage, the name of the notification integration in each target account must match the name of
the notification integration in the source account.
Configure notifications for secondary auto-ingest pipes
¶
You must take additional steps to configure cloud notifications for secondary auto-ingest pipes before failover.
This section covers why this additional configuration is required, and how to complete it for each supported cloud provider.
Amazon S3
¶
The configuration process depends on how you set up event notifications. For example,
suppose you have an auto-ingest pipe that relies on an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic
to publish messages about the Snowflake stage location.
When you replicate the pipe to a target account, Snowflake automatically creates a new Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.
You must subscribe this SQS queue for your target account to the SNS topic to get notifications about the stage location.
If you use Amazon S3 Event Notifications with Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS),
follow the instructions in
Step 4: Configure event notifications
.
Important
To ensure that the pipe has not missed any notifications, you should refresh the pipe after switching to the new SQS queue.
You can also migrate from SQS to SNS. For more information, see
Migrate to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
.
If you use Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), see
Subscribing the Snowflake SQS Queue to your SNS topic
.
If you use Amazon EventBridge, see
Option 3: Setting up Amazon EventBridge to automate Snowpipe
.
Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
¶
A pipe that automatically loads data from files located on a stage in Microsoft Azure blob storage requires an Event Grid
subscription, storage queue, and a notification integration bound to the storage queue. A secondary pipe in a target account needs a separate
Event Grid, storage queue, and notification integration bound to the storage queue. The Event Grid in both source and target accounts must be
configured as endpoints for the same Azure Storage source.
See the diagram below for configuration details:
Create a new Event Grid subscription and storage queue. Then, create a new notification integration in the target account and
grant Snowflake access to your storage queue. For instructions, see
Configuring Automation With Azure Event Grid
.
Important
The name of the notification integration in each target account
must
match the name of the notification integration in
the source account.
External stage for Google Cloud Storage
¶
A pipe that automatically loads data from files located in Google Cloud Storage requires a
Google Pub/Sub subscription and a notification integration
that references that subscription. Each replicated pipe in a target account also requires a Google Pub/Sub subscription and a
notification integration that references that subscription.
The Pub/Sub subscription in each source and target account must be subscribed to the same Pub/Sub Topic
that receives notifications from the Google Cloud Storage source.
See the diagram below for configuration details:
Create a new subscription to your Pub/Sub topic and a new notification integration in your target account.
Then, grant Snowflake access to the Pub/Sub subscription. For instructions,
see
Configuring Automation Using GCS Pub/Sub
.
Important
The name of the notification integration in each target account
must
match the name of the notification integration in
the source account.
Updating the remote service for API integrations
¶
If you have enabled API integration replication, additional steps are required after the API integration is replicated to the target account.
The replicated integration has its own identity and access management (IAM) entity that are different from the identity and IAM entity
of the primary integration. Therefore, you must update the permissions on the remote service to grant access to replicated functions.
The process is similar to granting access to the functions on the primary account. See the below links for more details:
Amazon Web Services
Set up the trust relationship(s) between Snowflake and the new IAM role
.
Google Cloud Platform:
Create a GCP Security Policy for the Proxy Service
.
Microsoft Azure:
Step 1.
Link the API integration for Azure
Step 2.
Create a validate-JWT policy
Comparing data sets in primary and secondary databases
¶
Snowflake performs automatic verification checks as part of each replication refresh operation.
If a verification failure occurs, the refresh fails. Therefore, you don’t have to manually verify
the replicated data. If you need additional verification for compliance reasons, you
can perform manual verification steps after the refresh operation finishes.
Automatic verification by Snowflake
¶
Snowflake currently performs the following checks between the primary and secondary account, after each refresh operation:
Snowflake compares the hash values between the primary and secondary account, for all files that were replicated.
For each table, Snowflake compares the following values between the primary and secondary account:
File count.
Row count.
Byte count.
Manual verification
¶
If database objects are replicated in a replication or failover group, you can use the
HASH_AGG
function to compare the rows in some or all tables in a
primary and secondary database to verify data consistency. The HASH_AGG function returns an
aggregate signed 64-bit hash value over the set of input rows. The hash value is the same regardless
of the ordering of the input rows.
Query this function on all tables, or a random subset of tables, in both the secondary account and
the primary account. On the primary account, use an
AT | BEFORE
clause
to specify the point in time of the latest refresh for the associated database. Compare the output
between the queries on both accounts.
Example of manually verifying data after a refresh
¶
In the following examples, the database
mydb
is included in the failover group
myfg
. The
database
mydb
contains the table
myschema.mytable
.
Commands to run on target account
¶
Query the
REPLICATION_GROUP_REFRESH_PROGRESS
table function
(in the
Snowflake Information Schema
). Note the
primarySnapshotTimestamp
in the
DETAILS
column for the
PRIMARY_UPLOADING_METADATA
phase. This is the timestamp for the latest refresh of that database on the primary account.
SELECT
PARSE_JSON
(
details
)[
'primarySnapshotTimestamp'
]
FROM
TABLE
(
information_schema
.
replication_group_refresh_progress
(
'myfg'
))
WHERE
PHASE_NAME
=
'PRIMARY_UPLOADING_METADATA'
;
Copy
Query the HASH_AGG function for a specified table in the secondary account. The following query returns a hash value for all rows
in the
myschema.mytable
table:
SELECT
HASH_AGG
(
*
)
FROM
mydb
.
myschema
.
mytable
;
Copy
Commands to run on source account
¶
Query the HASH_AGG function for the same table in the primary account. Using Time Travel, specify the timestamp when the latest
refresh was performed for the secondary database:
SELECT
HASH_AGG
(
*
)
FROM
mydb
.
myschema
.
mytable
AT
(
TIMESTAMP
=>
'<primarySnapshotTimestamp>'
::TIMESTAMP
);
Copy
Compare the results from the two queries. The output should be identical.
Modifying a replication or failover group in a source account
¶
You can edit the name, included objects, and replication schedule of a replication or failover group in a source
account using Snowsight or
SQL
.
Note
Replication groups can’t be changed to failover groups or vice versa. To enable or disable failover, delete
the group and recreate it with the correct failover setting.
Modify a replication or failover group in a source account using Snowsight
¶
Note
Only account administrators can edit a replication or failover group using Snowsight (refer to

Dropping a secondary replication or failover group
¶
You can drop a secondary replication or failover using the
DROP REPLICATION GROUP
or the
DROP FAILOVER GROUP
command. Only the replication or failover group owner (that is, the role with the OWNERSHIP
privilege on the group) can drop the group.
To drop a secondary replication or failover group using Snowsight, you must drop the group in the source account. See
Drop a replication or failover group using Snowsight
.
Dropping a primary replication or failover group
¶
You can drop a primary replication or failover group using Snowsight or SQL. If you are deleting a primary group using SQL,
you must first drop all secondary groups. See
Dropping a secondary replication or failover group
.
Drop a primary replication or failover group using SQL
¶
A primary replication or failover group can only be dropped after all the replicas of the group (that is, secondary replication or failover
groups) have been dropped. Alternatively, you can promote a secondary failover group to serve as the primary failover group,
then drop the former primary failover group.
Note that only the group owner can drop the group.
Drop a replication or failover group using Snowsight

Troubleshoot issues with creating and editing replication groups using Snowsight
¶
The following scenarios can help you troubleshoot common issues that can occur when creating or editing replication or
failover group using Snowsight.
You cannot add a database to a group
You cannot add a share to a group
You cannot add a database to a group
¶
Error
Database '<database_name>' is already configured to replicate to
account '<account_name>' by replication group '<group_name>'.
Cause
A database can only be in one replication or failover group. One of the databases you selected for the group is already
included in another replication or failover group.
Solution
Choose
Select Databases
and unselect any database(s) that are already included in another group.
Error
Cannot directly add previously replicated object '<database_name>' to a
replication group. Please use the provided system functions to convert
this object first.
Cause
The database you want to add to a replication or failover group was previously configured for database replication.
Solution
Disable database replication for the database. See
Transitioning from database replication to group-based replication
.
You cannot add a share to a group
¶
Error
Share '<share_name>' is already configured to replicate to
account '<account_name>' by replication group '<group_name>'.
Cause
A share can only be in one replication or failover group. One of the shares you selected for the group is already included
in another replication or failover group.
Solution
Choose
Select Objects
and unselect any share(s) that are already included in another group.
Limitations of using Snowsight for replication configuration
¶
Only a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a replication or failover group using Snowsight. A user with a role with the
CREATE REPLICATION GROUP or CREATE FAILOVER GROUP privilege can create a group using the respective SQL commands.
Only a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can edit or drop a replication or failover group using Snowsight. A user with a role
with the OWNERSHIP privilege on a replication or failover group can edit and drop groups using the respective SQL commands.
If your account uses private connectivity, you can’t use Snowsight to create, modify, or drop groups. You can use SQL
to complete these actions.
