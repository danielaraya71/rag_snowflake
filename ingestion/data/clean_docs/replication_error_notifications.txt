Error notifications for replication and failover groups
¶
Standard & Business Critical Feature
Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
You can receive error notifications for refresh operation failures by setting a notification integration for a primary replication
or failover group.
Error notifications for refresh operation failures
¶
When you enable error notifications for a replication or failover group, a notification is sent via the designated email, cloud messaging
service, or the webhook when a refresh operation fails.
Notifications includes the following information:
Source and target account names.
Source and target regions (and region group, if applicable).
Primary and secondary replication or failover group name.
Timestamp when the error occurred.
Error code and message.
Source and target login URL.
Error notifications and failover
¶
Notifications are enabled on the primary replication or failover group and sent using a notification integration. The
notification integration is not required to be replicated to the target account. In the case of failover, if the notification
integration has been replicated, or there is an existing notification integration with the same name, in the newly promoted
source account, error notifications continue to be sent.
If the notification integration is not available, error notifications are not sent for refresh operation failures.
Prerequisite: Notification integration for error notifications
¶
A notification integration is required to send error notifications. The notification integration must be one of the
following types to send email notifications on refresh operation failures:
TYPE = EMAIL
:
The email notification integration must have at least one verified email address in the DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS list.
For more information about creating an email notification with a default list of recipients, see
Specify a default list of recipients and a default subject line
.
TYPE = QUEUE
:
You can use a notification integration that is configured to push notifications to a messaging service for any of the
cloud providers supported by Snowflake. You must set the notification integration TYPE parameter to QUEUE and the DIRECTION
parameter to OUTBOUND.
For more information, see
Sending notifications to cloud provider queues (Amazon SNS, Google Cloud PubSub, and Azure Event Grid)
.
TYPE = WEBHOOK
:
You can use a notification integration that is configured to push notifications to a webhook for any of the external systems
supported by Snowflake. Set the notification integration TYPE parameter to WEBHOOK. You may also need to create a secret
(if required by the external system).
For more information, see
Sending webhook notifications
.
Create a notification integration (TYPE = EMAIL)
¶
To create an email notification integration named
my_notification_int
with email address
first.last@example.com
, follow
these steps:
Ensure that the email address
first.last@example.com
has been verified
.
Create the notification integration by executing the
CREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION
command. For example:
CREATE
NOTIFICATION
INTEGRATION
my_notification_int
TYPE
=
EMAIL
ENABLED
=
TRUE
DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS
=
(
'first.last@example.com'
);
Copy
Create a notification integration (TYPE = QUEUE)
¶
To create a notification integration for pushing notifications to a cloud provider queue, follow the instructions provided for the
currently supported cloud provider queues:
Creating a notification integration to send notifications to an Amazon SNS topic
Creating a notification integration to send notifications to a Microsoft Azure Event Grid topic
Creating a notification integration to send notifications to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic
Create a notification integration (TYPE = WEBHOOK)
¶
To create a notification integration for pushing notifications to an external system webhook, follow the instructions provided for
the currently supported external system webhooks:
Creating a
Slack secret
and
Slack notification integration
Creating a
Microsoft Teams secret
and
Microsoft Teams notification integration
Creating a
PagerDuty secret
and
PagerDuty notification integration
Important
The webhook notification integration must specify the WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE parameter with
SNOWFLAKE_WEBHOOK_MESSAGE
as a placeholder value. When the notification is sent, the placeholder is replaced with the contents of the replication
error notification, as described in
Error notifications for refresh operation failures
.
The format for specifying WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE depends on the external system:
For Slack or Microsoft Teams, WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE utilizes the following single-value JSON object
format as its value:
WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE='
{
"text":
"SNOWFLAKE_WEBHOOK_MESSAGE"
}
'
Copy
For PagerDuty, WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE utilizes a multi-value JSON object as its value, but with the following differences
from a standard PagerDuty notification integration:
Within the
payload
key, the
summary
key is
not
used to specify
SNOWFLAKE_WEBHOOK_MESSAGE
.
Instead, an additional
custom_details
key is used to specify
SNOWFLAKE_WEBHOOK_MESSAGE
.
For example:
WEBHOOK_BODY_TEMPLATE='
{
"routing_key":
"SNOWFLAKE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
,
"event_action":
"trigger"
,
"payload":
{
"summary":
"Snowflake replication failure"
,
"source":
"Snowflake monitoring"
,
"severity":
"INFO"
,
"custom_details":
{
"message":
"SNOWFLAKE_WEBHOOK_MESSAGE"
}
}
}
'

Add an error notification for a replication or failover group
¶
To enable error notifications for an existing replication/failover group, use the
ALTER REPLICATION GROUP
or
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP
command to set the ERROR_INTEGRATION parameter.
For example, add notification integration
my_notification_int
to failover group
my_fg
. The following statement must
be executed from the
source
account:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
my_fg
SET
ERROR_INTEGRATION
=
my_notification_int
;
Copy
To create a replication/failover group and enable error notifications, use the
CREATE REPLICATION GROUP
or
CREATE FAILOVER GROUP
command and set the ERROR_INTEGRATION parameter.
For example, to create failover group
my_fg
to enable replication and failover of databases
db1
,
db2
to accounts
myaccount2
and
myaccount2
in organization
myorg
, execute the following statement in the
source
account to
create a primary failover group:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
my_fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
DATABASES
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
db1
,
db2
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2
,
myorg
.
myaccount3
REPLICATION_SCHEDULE
=
'10 MINUTE'
ERROR_INTEGRATION
=
my_notification_int
;
Copy
Note
If the replication schedule for a replication or failover group is set to a high frequency, for example one minute,
error notifications for the same issue are sent for every scheduled refresh operation.
