 We refer to this operation as a
bulk failover
.
To promote a target account to serve as the source account using Snowsight, follow these steps:
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
Make sure to sign in using the target account
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Replication
, then select
Initiate failover
. Doing so brings up a dialog where you make the remaining choices.
Select any failover groups to promote.  After the failover, the objects specified in those
failover groups become writable on the newly promoted primary account. Those objects become
read-only on the account that formerly was the primary and is now a secondary account.
Select
Next
.
Select any connections to promote. After the failover, those connections connect to the account
that you’re promoting to be the new primary account.
Select
Next
.
Select
Fail over
in the confirmation window.
If any refresh operations are in progress for the failover groups you selected, you can wait for those refreshes
to complete, or choose an alternative approach if your failover is urgent and should take priority.
The default action is to wait for the refreshes to complete. That way, the primary and secondary systems are all
in a consistent state when the bulk failover runs. Snowflake uses your currently selected warehouse to poll the
status of the ongoing refreshes. If you don’t have a selected warehouse, you select one now using the
Select warehouse
option.
Or, you can proceed with the failover immediately by selecting
Show advanced options
.
To fail over only the failover groups that aren’t currently being refreshed, select
Exit with current progress
.
In that case, you perform additional refreshes later for the groups that were skipped during the bulk failover.
To cancel the refresh operations and continue the failover, select
Cancel refreshes and force failover
.
In that case, you might need to clean up any inconsistencies on the secondary system from the interrupted refreshes.
If the failover operation didn’t complete for all failover groups, you can perform another bulk failover. Or you can fail over
the remaining failover groups one at a time, using the procedure in
Promote a single failover group to serve as the primary using Snowsight
.
