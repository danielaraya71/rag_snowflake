Note that
secretsdb
is the name of the database that contains the secret and
destdb
is the name of the database that contains
the ingested data from ServiceNow.
Update the failover group to include API integrations and the databases containing the secret and ingested data using an ALTER FAILOVER
GROUP command.

Verify connecting to each Snowflake account using the method of your choice (such as Snowflake CLI, a browser, or SnowSQL).
Optionally promote the secondary failover group and the secondary connection in the target account to primary. This will promote the
target account to serve as the new source account.
Failover group:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
PRIMARY
;
Copy
Connection:
ALTER
CONNECTION
global
PRIMARY
;

If you completed the previous step, reverify that you can connect to each Snowflake account.
At this point, the target account contains the replicated objects and users can login. However, there are additional steps in the target
account to use the connector.
Update the remote service associated with the API integration in the cloud platform that hosts your Snowflake account.
For details, refer to
Updating the remote service for API integrations
.
Install the connector manually or with Snowsight. For details, refer to:
