 privilege to view. You can use the tiles to filter the view.
For example, if the
Status
tile indicates there are failed refresh operations, you can select the tile to investigate the group(s)
with failures.
The lag time in the
Longest Replication lag
tile refers to the duration of time since the last refresh operation. This is the
length of time that the secondary replication or failover group
lags
behind the primary group. The longest lag time is the
length of time since the oldest secondary replication group was last refreshed.
For example, if you have three failover groups,
fg_1
,
fg_2
,
fg_3
, with independent replication schedules of
10 minutes, 2 hours, and 12 hours respectively, the longest lag time could be as long as 12 hours. If
fg_3
, however, was
recently refreshed in the target account, its lag time resets to 0 and a different failover group could have a longer lag time.
You can select an individual bar in the
Group Lag Distribution
tile to filter the results to an individual group.
You can also filter groups by using the search field or the dropdown menus:
You can search by replication or failover group name using the

Choose
