 in Account Usage, Organization Usage, and Information Schema
APPLY BACKUP POLICY, APPLY BACKUP RETENTION LOCK privileges
The former SNAPSHOT/SNAPSHOTS names are still present but deprecated in favor of their BACKUP/BACKUPS equivalents.
For example:
CREATE SNAPSHOT POLICY is deprecated; use CREATE BACKUP POLICY instead.
SNAPSHOTS view is deprecated; use BACKUPS view instead.
APPLY SNAPSHOT POLICY privilege is deprecated; use APPLY BACKUP POLICY privilege instead.
The deprecated commands, views, and privileges continue to work, but Snowflake intends to remove them in a future release.
