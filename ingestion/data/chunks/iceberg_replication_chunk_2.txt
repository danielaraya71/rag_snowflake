 storage location
for the secondary
external volume.
In the source account, create a Snowflake-managed Iceberg table that uses the external volume that you updated with the additional storage
location.
For example:
CREATE
ICEBERG
TABLE
my_iceberg_table
(
amount
int
)
CATALOG
=
'SNOWFLAKE'
EXTERNAL_VOLUME
=
'exvol1'
BASE_LOCATION
=
'my_iceberg_table'
;
Copy
In the source account, retrieve information about the
Snowflake service principal
for
your
target account
by following these steps:
Retrieve the name (
account_name
) of your target account by using the
SHOW REPLICATION ACCOUNTS
command.
SHOW
REPLICATION
ACCOUNTS
LIKE
'my_target_account%'
;
Copy
Call the
SYSTEM$DESC_ICEBERG_ACCESS_IDENTITY
system function.
Specify the cloud provider for the target storage location and the name of your target account
exactly
as
it appears in the
account_name
column of the SHOW REPLICATION ACCOUNTS output.
For example:
SELECT
SYSTEM$DESC_ICEBERG_ACCESS_IDENTITY
(
'S3'
,
'MY_TARGET_ACCOUNT_1'
);
Copy
Configure Snowflake access to the storage location associated with your target account.
Follow the instructions for your cloud provider, using the information you retrieved for the service principal in the target account:
Configure an external volume for Amazon S3
. Use the external ID associated with the storage location for your target account.
Configure an external volume for Google Cloud Storage
Configure an external volume for Azure
. In the
AZURE_CONSENT_URL
TEMPLATE
returned by
SYSTEM$DESC_ICEBERG_ACCESS_IDENTITY, replace
your_tenant_id
with the ID for your
tenant that the storage location belongs to.
In the source account, use the
CREATE FAILOVER GROUP
command to create a failover group.
Specify
EXTERNAL
VOLUMES
in the
OBJECT_TYPES
list. In the
ALLOWED_DATABASES
list, include the database with the Iceberg tables that you want to replicate. In the
ALLOWED_EXTERNAL_VOLUMES
list, include the external volumes that provide access to the Iceberg tables that you want to replicate.
