USE
ROLE
my_replication_role

ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
REFRESH

Step 7. Grant the FAILOVER privilege on failover group to role —
Optional
¶
To execute the command to fail over a secondary failover group in a target account, you must use a role with the
FAILOVER privilege
on the failover group. The FAILOVER privilege is currently
not
replicated and must be granted in each source and target account.
For more information, see
Replication of roles and grants
.
For example, to grant the FAILOVER privilege to role
my_failover_role
on failover group
my_fg
, execute the
following statement in the
target account
using a role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group:
GRANT
FAILOVER
ON
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
TO
ROLE
my_failover_role
;
Copy

Schema-level replication for failover groups
¶
For databases in failover groups, you can optionally configure the REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter on the database
and/or individual schemas in the database to specify a subset of schemas for replication.
This feature enables you to control the schemas in a failover group that are replicated, which is useful if only a subset of data
in a database needs the added disaster recovery protection provided by failover.
Because this parameter is enabled by default for all databases and the schemas they contain, you adjust the replication
granularity by choosing which databases and/or schemas to omit from replication. You can further fine-tune the
replication settings by allowing certain schemas to be replicated even though the database that contains them isn’t replicated.
Specify schemas to replicate or skip
¶
You can explicitly specify schemas to replicate or skip in a database in a failover group using the
optional
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS
parameter.
REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter

The REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS parameter specifies whether a schema that belongs
