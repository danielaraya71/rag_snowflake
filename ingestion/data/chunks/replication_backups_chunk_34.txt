 the group that contains the backup set.
If you restore a schema backup or database backup on a secondary account, references to objects within the restored schema
or database might not resolve properly unless the referenced objects are part of the same failover group as the backup.
Monitor backups and backup operations

You can determine which backup-related objects exist, their properties, and how much storage they use
by querying the following views.

Account usage:
BACKUP_OPERATION_HISTORY view
BACKUP_POLICIES view

Backup policy

CREATE BACKUP POLICY
ALTER BACKUP POLICY
DROP BACKUP POLICY
SHOW BACKUP POLICIES
Backup set
¶
CREATE BACKUP SET
ALTER BACKUP SET
DROP BACKUP SET
SHOW BACKUP SETS
Backups
¶
You don’t run an actual CREATE BACKUP command. To create a new backup, you run ALTER BACKUP SET … ADD BACKUP.
Or when you associate the backup set with a backup policy that has a schedule, Snowflake automatically creates
backups in the backup set based on the specified schedule. To delete an older backup, you run ALTER BACKUP SET … DELETE
BACKUP. Such operations require you to specify the identifier for a specific backup. You can find the backup identifiers,
along with other information such as when each backup was created, by using the following command.
SHOW BACKUPS IN BACKUP SET
Restoring objects from backups
¶
You use the syntax CREATE
object_kind
FROM BACKUP SET to restore each kind of object
from the appropriate kind of backup set.
Further backups in the backup set use the original object, not the restored one. That’s true even
if you rename the restored object to the same name as the original object. If you want to continue using the
same backup set after doing a restore, you restore the object under a new name
and then transfer data back to the original object.
CREATE DATABASE FROM BACKUP SET
CREATE SCHEMA FROM BACKUP SET
CREATE TABLE FROM BACKUP SET
