View failover and replication group membership
¶
Account, database, and share objects have
constraints on group membership
. Before creating new
groups or adding objects to existing groups, you can review the list of existing failover groups and the objects in each group.
Note
Only an account administrator (user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) or the group owner (role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group) can
execute the SQL statements in this section.
View all failover groups linked to the current account, and the object types in each group:
SHOW FAILOVER GROUPS
;
Copy
View all the databases in failover group
myfg
:
SHOW DATABASES
IN
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
;
Copy
View all the shares in failover group
myfg
:
SHOW SHARES
IN
FAILOVER
GROUP
myfg
;
Copy
Step 3: Create a primary failover group in a source account
¶
Create a primary failover group and enable the replication and failover of specific objects from the current (source) account to one or more
target accounts in the same organization.
You can create a replication or failover group using
Snowsight
or
SQL
.

Note
If you have databases to add to a replication or failover group that have been previously enabled for database replication
using
ALTER DATABASE
, follow the
Transitioning from database replication to group-based replication
instructions (in this
topic) before adding them to a group.
