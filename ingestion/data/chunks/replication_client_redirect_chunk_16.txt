Authentication and Client Redirect
¶
Users must be provisioned in the source account and on each target account if security integrations are not
replicated
.
Federated authentication & SSO
¶
Configure federated authentication separately in each target account. Provide the identity provider (IdP) details using the setup
options in
Configuring Snowflake to use federated authentication
:
Note
Snowflake recommends configuring your SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider (IdP) with the connection URL rather than an account URL so
users are redirected to the correct account in case of failover.
OAuth
¶
Configure a security integration object for OAuth in each target account. The security integration object must be identical to the same
object in the source account. For instructions, see the appropriate topic:
Snowflake OAuth
External OAuth
To retrieve security integration properties, query the
DESCRIBE INTEGRATION
command for each security integration
in the source account. Then recreate each security integration in a target account by executing the
CREATE INTEGRATION
command.
OAuth redirect behavior
¶
If you are using Snowflake OAuth for authenticating a client connection and are connecting to Snowflake using a connection URL, you
are prompted
