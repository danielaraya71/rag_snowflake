To create a replication/failover group and enable error notifications, use the
CREATE REPLICATION GROUP
or
CREATE FAILOVER GROUP
command and set the ERROR_INTEGRATION parameter.
For example, to create failover group
my_fg
to enable replication and failover of databases
db1
,
db2
to accounts
myaccount2
and
myaccount2
in organization
myorg
, execute the following statement in the
source
account to
create a primary failover group:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
my_fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
DATABASES
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
db1
,
db2
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2
,
myorg
.
myaccount3
REPLICATION_SCHEDULE
=
'10 MINUTE'
ERROR_INTEGRATION
=
my_notification_int
;
Copy
Note
If the replication schedule for a replication or failover group is set to a high frequency, for example one minute,
error notifications for the same issue are sent for every scheduled refresh operation.
