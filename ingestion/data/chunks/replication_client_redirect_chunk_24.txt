 account URL after authentication is complete. The CONNECTION column for this login event is NULL. See
Authentication and Client Redirect
(in this topic).
For example, retrieve up to 100 login events of every user your current role is allowed to monitor in the last 72 hours:
SELECT
event_timestamp
,
user_name
,
client_ip
,
reported_client_type
,
is_success
,
connection
FROM
TABLE
(
INFORMATION_SCHEMA
.
LOGIN_HISTORY
(
DATEADD
(
'HOURS'
,-
72
,
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
()),
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
()))
ORDER
BY
EVENT_TIMESTAMP
;

Client connections using a connection URL and OAuth integration require re-authentication when the connection URL is updated to point to a
different account if the OAuth security integration is not replicated to that account. For more information, refer to
OAuth redirect behavior
.
Web browsers may take several minutes to redirect due to browser cache.
If you need to verify that the redirect works, you can connect to Snowflake with a
different client
.
Alternatively, open a new private browser window (e.g. incognito mode in Google Chrome) to avoid browser caching issues. Note that some web
browsers in private or incognito mode might still cache data. To avoid using the browser cache, close any open private browsers windows and
tabs before you open a new private browser window.
You can only add one target account using Snowsight. To add more than one target account to the list of allowed failover
accounts, use the
ALTER CONNECTION … ENABLE FAILOVER TO ACCOUNTS
command.
