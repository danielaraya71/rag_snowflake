Database replication
¶
Snowflake account replication supports replicating databases. Replication for a database includes the objects contained in that
database. The refresh operation for a database includes changes to the objects and data since the previous refresh for that database.
If
roles
are replicated (in the same or different replication or failover group), the database refresh also synchronizes the
privilege grants on the secondary database and the objects in the database (schemas, tables, views, etc.) to roles in the account.
Refer to
Grants for database objects
for more details.
Replication of some databases is not supported or might fail the refresh operation. For more information, see
Current limitations of replication
.
Replicated database objects
¶
When a primary database is replicated, a snapshot of its database objects and data is transferred to the secondary database. However,
some database objects are not replicated. The following table indicates which database objects are replicated to a secondary database.
For specific usage information about these objects, see
Replication considerations
.
Note
Objects that are
not
supported for replication are skipped during replication and won’t be available in the target account post failover.

By default, all schemas in replicated databases are replicated. If you use failover groups, you can choose
which schemas within a database are replicated. For more information, see
