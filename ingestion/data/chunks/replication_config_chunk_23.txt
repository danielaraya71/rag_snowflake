Dropping a secondary replication or failover group
¶
You can drop a secondary replication or failover using the
DROP REPLICATION GROUP
or the
DROP FAILOVER GROUP
command. Only the replication or failover group owner (that is, the role with the OWNERSHIP
privilege on the group) can drop the group.
To drop a secondary replication or failover group using Snowsight, you must drop the group in the source account. See
Drop a replication or failover group using Snowsight
.
Dropping a primary replication or failover group
¶
You can drop a primary replication or failover group using Snowsight or SQL. If you are deleting a primary group using SQL,
you must first drop all secondary groups. See
Dropping a secondary replication or failover group
.
Drop a primary replication or failover group using SQL
¶
A primary replication or failover group can only be dropped after all the replicas of the group (that is, secondary replication or failover
groups) have been dropped. Alternatively, you can promote a secondary failover group to serve as the primary failover group,
then drop the former primary failover group.
Note that only the group owner can drop the group.
