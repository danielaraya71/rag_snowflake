Replication and references across replication groups
¶
Objects in a replication (or failover) group that have dangling references (i.e. references to objects in another replication or failover
group) might successfully replicate to a target account in some circumstances. If the replication operation results in behavior in the
target account consistent with behavior that can occur in the source account, replication succeeds.
For example, if a column in a table in failover group
fg_a
references a sequence in failover group
fg_b
, replication of both
groups succeeds. If
fg_a
is replicated
