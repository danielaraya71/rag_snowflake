Stage, pipe, and load history replication
¶
Standard & Business Critical Feature
Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
This topic provides information about replication support for data pipeline objects and related metadata,
including stages, storage integrations, pipes, and load history. You can replicate these objects to configure failover for ingest and ETL
pipelines across
regions
and across
cloud platforms
.
Before you get started, we recommend that you have familiarity with Snowflake support for replication and failover/failback.
For more information, see
Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts
.
Requirements
¶
Important
If a database in a target account that you plan to use
already
contains stages and pipes, we recommend that you contact support
before enabling replication. When a replication or failover group in your source account includes that database, any pre-existing stages
and pipes are dropped from the database.
To replicate any external stages that use a storage integration, you must configure your replication or failover group to replicate
STORAGE
INTEGRATIONS
. Otherwise, external stages are replicated without the associated storage integration.
You can use an
ALTER REPLICATION GROUP
or
ALTER FAILOVER GROUP
statement to modify these properties for an existing group.
If you add
INTEGRATIONS
to the
OBJECT_TYPES
list in your ALTER statement,
include any other existing objects in the list to avoid dropping those objects in the target account.
The same applies if you add
STORAGE
INTEGRATIONS
to the
ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES
list.
For example:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
my_failover_group
SET
OBJECT_TYPES
=
ROLES
,
INTEGRATIONS
ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES
=
API INTEGRATIONS
,
STORAGE INTEGRATIONS
;
Copy
Note
Your cloud storage provider might limit replication of data pipeline objects between commercial and government cloud regions. To avoid
government cloud data replication limitations, configure your failover resources in any region accessible to your government cloud region.
For more information about government cloud limitations, review your cloud storage provider’s documentation.
Replication and stages

This section describes the current level of replication functionality that Snowflake supports for different types of stages.
