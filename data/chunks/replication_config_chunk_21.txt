Query the HASH_AGG function for a specified table in the secondary account. The following query returns a hash value for all rows
in the
myschema.mytable
table:
SELECT
HASH_AGG
(

FROM
mydb
.
myschema
.
mytable
;

Commands to run on source account

Query the HASH_AGG function for the same table in the primary account. Using Time Travel, specify the timestamp when the latest
refresh was performed for the secondary database:
SELECT
HASH_AGG
(
*
)
FROM
mydb
.
myschema
.
mytable
AT
(
TIMESTAMP
=>
'<primarySnapshotTimestamp>'
::TIMESTAMP
);

Compare the results from the two queries. The output should be identical.
Modifying a replication or failover group in a source account
¶
You can edit the name, included objects, and replication schedule of a replication or failover group in a source
account using Snowsight or
SQL
.
Note
Replication groups can’t be changed to failover groups or vice versa. To enable or disable failover, delete
the group and recreate it with the correct failover setting.
