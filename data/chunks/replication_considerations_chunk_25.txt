Replication and instances of Snowflake classes
¶
An instance of the
CUSTOM_CLASSIFIER
class is replicated when the database that contains
the instance is replicated. Replication of instances of other Snowflake
classes
is
not
supported.
Historical usage data
¶
Historical usage data for activity in a primary database is not replicated to secondary databases. Each account has its own query history,
login history, etc.
Historical usage data includes the query data returned by the following
Snowflake Information Schema
table functions or
Account Usage
views:
COPY_HISTORY
LOGIN_HISTORY
QUERY_HISTORY
etc.
