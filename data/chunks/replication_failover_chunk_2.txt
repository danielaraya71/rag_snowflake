 case, you might need to clean up any inconsistencies on the secondary system from the interrupted refreshes.
If the failover operation didn’t complete for all failover groups, you can perform another bulk failover. Or you can fail over
the remaining failover groups one at a time, using the procedure in
Promote a single failover group to serve as the primary using Snowsight
.
Promote a single failover group to serve as the primary using Snowsight
¶
Note
Only account administrators can edit a replication or failover group using Snowsight (see
Limitations of using Snowsight for replication configuration
).
To promote a single failover group to be the primary using Snowsight, follow these steps:
Sign in to
Snowsight
.
Make sure to sign in using the target account
.
In the navigation menu, select
Admin
»
Accounts
.
Select
Replication
, then select
Groups
.
Locate the failover group that you want to promote, and select the
More
menu (
…
) in the last column of the row.
Select
Fail over
, then select
Fail over
in the confirmation window.
Tip
You typically use this procedure if you encounter a problem failing over one group, and you need to retry the
failover only for that group. To promote an entire account to be the primary, select multiple failover groups and connections and
perform a bulk failover. For more information, see
Promote a target account to serve as the source account using Snowsight
