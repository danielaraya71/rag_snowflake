NETWORK
POLICIES
and
ACCOUNT
PARAMETERS
in the
OBJECT_TYPES
list.
If a network policy is associated with a user, include
NETWORK
POLICIES
and
USERS
in the
OBJECT_TYPES
list.

Dangling references and packages policies
¶
If there is a
packages policy
set on the account, the following dangling references
error occurs during the refresh operation for a replication or failover group that contains account objects:
003131 (55000): Dangling references in the snapshot. Correct the errors before refreshing again.
The following references are missing (referred entity <- [referring entities]):
POLICY '<policy_db>.<policy_schema>.<packages_policy_name>' <- [ACCOUNT '<account_locator>']
To avoid dangling references, replicate the database that contains the packages policy to the target account. The database containing the
policy can be in the same or different replication or failover group.
Dangling references and secrets
¶
For details, see
Replication and secrets
.
Dangling references and streams
¶
Dangling references for streams cause replication to fail with the following error message:
Primary database: the source object ''<object_name>'' for this stream ''<stream_name>'' is not included in the replication group.
Stream replication does not support replication across databases in different replication groups. Please see Streams Documentation
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/account-replication-considerations#replication-and-streams for options.
To avoid dangling reference errors:
The primary database must include both the stream and its base object
or
The database that contains the stream and the database that contains the base object referenced by the stream must be included in the
same replication or failover group.
Replication and read-only secondary objects
¶
All secondary objects in a target account, including secondary databases and shares, are read-only. Changes to replicated objects or object types
cannot be made locally in a target account. For example, if the
USERS
object type is replicated from a source
account to a target account, new users cannot be created or modified in the target account.
New, local databases and shares
can
be created and modified in a target account. If
ROLES
are also replicated
to the target account, new roles cannot be created or modified in that target account.
