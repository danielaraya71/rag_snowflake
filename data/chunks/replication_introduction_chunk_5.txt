Packages policies
Python UDF, UDTF, stored procedures
✔
If there is a
packages policy
set on the source account, in order
to successfully replicate account objects, the database containing the packages policy
must
be replicated to the target account
in the same or different replication or failover group. Otherwise, the refresh operation fails with a
dangling references error

Database replication and encryption
¶
Snowflake protects metadata and data sets at rest and in transit between the source and target accounts. The account
master key
(AMK) encrypts the key hierarchy within the account as shown in the
hierarchical key model
. Snowflake encrypts replicated data in the target account using the
account master key and the key hierarchy in the target account, regardless of whether you enable Tri-Secret Secure in the target account.
When you enable Tri-Secret Secure in the target account, Snowflake uses the composite master key and the corresponding key hierarchy in
the target account to encrypt the data. Note that target accounts do not have Tri-Secret Secure enabled by default; you must enable this
feature.

External volume replication
¶
Preview Feature
— Open
Available to all accounts.
Standard & Business Critical Feature
Replication of external volumes to a replication group is available to all accounts.
Replication of external volumes to a failover group requires Business Critical Edition or later.
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Iceberg tables rely on external volumes, which are
account-level objects that require
