Notes
Schemas

which schemas within a database are replicated. For more information, see
Schema-level replication for failover groups
.
Tables
Permanent tables
✔
Transient tables
✔
Temporary tables
Automatic Clustering of clustered tables
✔
Dynamic tables
✔
For more information, see
Replication and dynamic tables
.
External tables
Hybrid tables
Apache Iceberg™ tables
✔
Only Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables are supported. Replication for Iceberg tables requires external volume replication.
For more information, see
Configure replication for Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg™ tables
.
Interactive tables
Currently,
interactive tables
aren’t replicated.
Table constraints
✔
Except if a foreign key in the database references a primary/unique key in another database.
