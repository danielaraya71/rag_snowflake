Parameter replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
This feature supports replicating account-level parameters and object parameters. Object parameters are replicated when the object is
included in the replication group. For example, if
WAREHOUSES
are replicated, warehouse-specific parameters
(e.g.
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS
) are replicated. For a full list, see
Object parameters
.
Account-level parameter replication includes all
Account parameters
and
parameters set on the account
.
Account-level parameters (e.g.
DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS
) are replicated when
ACCOUNT
PARAMETERS
is included in
the list of object types for a replication group.
Resource monitor replication
¶
Business Critical Feature
Requires Business Critical Edition (or higher).
This feature supports replicating resource monitors and privileges granted on resource monitors to roles. A secondary resource monitor
follows the same quota reset schedule as its primary. For example, if the quota on the primary resource monitor resets on the first of the
month, and the secondary is first replicated on the 15th of the month, its quota will reset on the first of the next month along with the
primary.
Replication of resource monitor email notification settings
¶
Email notification settings for resource monitors are not included with resource monitor replication. Email notifications for
non-administrator users can be replicated with resource monitors. However, account administrator notification settings are
currently not replicated:
If
users
and
resource
monitors
are included in the
object_types
list for the replication or failover group,
notification settings for non-administrator users are replicated:
The
notify_users
list for a warehouse-level resource monitor is replicated to target accounts.
Email notifications for non-administrator users
are sent
on the target account.
If
resource
monitors
is included in the
object_types
list for the replication or failover group, but
users
is not included, the
notify_users
list for a secondary warehouse-level resource monitor is empty.
Account administrator notification settings are
not
replicated:
An account administrator must
