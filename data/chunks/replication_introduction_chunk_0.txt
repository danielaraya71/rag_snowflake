Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts
¶
Standard and Business Critical Feature
Database and share replication are available to all accounts.
Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).
To inquire about upgrading, please contact
Snowflake Support
.
This feature enables the replication of objects from a
source
account to one or more
target
accounts in the same organization.
Replicated objects in each target account are referred to as
secondary
objects and are replicas of the
primary
objects in the source
account. Replication is supported across
regions
and across
cloud platforms
.
Region support for replication and failover/failback
¶
All Snowflake regions across Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure support replication.
Customers can replicate across all regions within a
region group
. To replicate between regions in
different region groups, (i.e. from a Snowflake commercial region to a Snowflake government or Virtual Private Snowflake region),
please contact
Snowflake Support
.
Replication groups and failover groups
¶
A
replication group
is a defined collection of objects in a source account that are replicated as a unit to one or more target accounts. Replication groups provide read-only access for the replicated objects.
A
failover group
is a replication group that can also fail over. A secondary failover group in a target account provides read-only access for the replicated objects. When a secondary failover group is promoted to become the primary failover group, read-write access is available. You can promote any target account specified in the list of allowed accounts in a failover group to serve as the primary failover group.
Replication and failover groups provide point-in-time consistency for the objects on the target account. The objects that can be included in a replication or failover group are listed below in
Replicated objects
.
