Estimating and controlling costs
¶
In general, monthly billing for replication is proportional to:
Amount of table data in the primary database, or databases in a replication/failover group, that changes as a result of data loading
or DML operations.
Frequency of secondary database, or replication/failover group, refreshes from the primary database or replication/failover group.
You can control the cost of replication by carefully choosing which databases or objects to replicate and their refresh frequency. You
can stop incurring replication costs by ceasing refresh operations.

Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can use SQL to view the amount of data transferred (in bytes) and the credit usage for
replication using replication or failover groups for your Snowflake account within a specified date range.
Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can use
Snowsight
or SQL to view the amount of replication data transferred
(in bytes) for your Snowflake account within a specified date range.
Snowsight

.
To view the data transfer amounts and credit usage for replication for your account:
SQL
:
Query either of the following:
REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY
table function (in the
Snowflake Information Schema
). This
function returns replication usage activity within the last 14 days.
REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY view
(in
Account Usage
). This view returns
replication usage activity within the last 365 days (1 year).
For examples, see
Monitor replication costs
.
To view the cost of replication for individual databases replicated with Database Replication, see
