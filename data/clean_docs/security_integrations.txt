Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts
¶
Business Critical Feature
Account object replication and failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please
contact
Snowflake Support
.
This topic provides information on how to replicate security integrations, along with using failover/failback with
each of these objects, and assumes familiarity with replication and failover/failback with other account-level objects
(e.g. users, roles, warehouses).
For details, see
Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts
.
These objects and services are supported across
regions
and across
cloud platforms
.
Overview
¶
Snowflake supports replicating network policies and security integrations for federated SSO (i.e. SAML2), OAuth, and SCIM along with
enabling failover/failback for each network policy and integration.
The general approach to test replication and failover/failback with each network policy and security integration is as follows:
Identify the source account and target account for replication, and identify the connection URL.
Complete steps in the source account.
Complete steps in the target account.
Test failover/failback.
Note that because network policies and security integrations have different use cases, the exact steps for the source account and target
account with respect to each object differ slightly.

Replicating SAML2 security integrations
¶
Replicating a SAML2 security integration links the source account and the target account to the identity provider by specifying the
connection URL
in the SAML2 security integration definition.
It is important to update the identity provider to specify the connection URL and that users exist in the source account. Without these
updates, user verification cannot occur, which will result in the inability of the user to access the target account.
Current Limitation
:
For SAML SSO to Snowflake, replicating a SAML2 security integration that specifies the connection URL is only supported on the current
primary connection and not supported on the secondary connection. Note that for failover, the result is promoting a secondary connection
to serve as the primary connection. After failover, SAML SSO works on the new primary connection.
If SAML SSO is needed for both primary and secondary connections, then create and manage SAML2 security integrations independently on
both Snowflake accounts.
For this procedure, assume the following:
Source account:
https://example-northamericawest.snowflakecomputing.com/
Target account:
https://example-northamericaeast.snowflakecomputing.com/
Connection URL:
https://example-global.snowflakecomputing.com
A secondary connection does not exist in the target account.
This procedure is a representative example to do the following:
Replicate a SAML2 security integration from the source account to the target account.
Test failover.
Promote the secondary connection in the source account to serve as the primary connection.
Source account steps (includes IdP steps):
If the source account is already configured for
Database Failover/Failback and Client Redirect
,
skip to the next step.
Otherwise, enable failover using an
ALTER CONNECTION
command:

Using Okta as a representative example for the identity provider, create a
Snowflake application in Okta
that specifies the connection URL. Update
the Okta fields as follows:
Label

Subdomain

example-global
Browser plugin auto-submit
: Check the box to enable automatic login when a user lands on the login page.
In the source account, update the SAML2 security integration to specify the connection URL for the
saml2_snowflake_issuer_url
and
saml2_snowflake_acs_url
security integration properties.

In Okta, assign the Snowflake application to users. For details, see
Assign an app integration to a user
.
Verify that SSO to the source account works for users that are specified in the Snowflake application in Okta and users in the source
account.
Note that SSO should work for both IdP-initiated and Snowflake-initiated SSO flows. For details, see
Supported SSO workflows
.
In the source account, if a failover group does not already exist,
create
a failover group to
include security integrations. Note that this example is representative and includes other account objects that might or might not be
necessary to replicate.
If a failover group already exists,
alter
the failover group to include integrations.

If the refresh operation was successful, the target account should include new users that were added to the source account and not

the connection URL.
Verify the refresh operation was successful by executing the following commands:
SHOW INTEGRATIONS
(should include 1 new integration)
SHOW USERS
(should include the number of new users added)
DESCRIBE INTEGRATION

Replicating SCIM security integrations
¶
Replicating a SCIM security integration allows the target account to incorporate SCIM updates that are made to the source account
(e.g. adding new users, adding new roles) after refreshing the target account.
After replicating the SCIM security integration, both Snowflake accounts have the ability to receive SCIM updates from the identity
provider. However, Snowflake allows specifying only one account as the
primary
(i.e. source) account and it is the primary account that
receives SCIM updates from the identity provider.
You can optionally designate a different account as the primary account to receive SCIM updates after replicating the SCIM integration.
Note that the target account can receive SCIM updates from the source account only after refreshing the target account.
For this procedure, assume the following:
Source account:
https://example-northamericawest.snowflakecomputing.com/
Target account:
https://example-northamericaeast.snowflakecomputing.com/
Connection URL:
https://example-global.snowflakecomputing.com
A secondary connection exists in the target account (i.e. only refresh operations are needed).
This procedure is a representative example to do the following:
Replicate a SCIM security integration from the source account to the target account.
Add a new user in Okta, push the new user to the source account, and replicate the new user to the target account.
Refresh the failover group.
Promote the secondary connection in the target account to serve as the primary connection.
Source account steps:
Execute
SHOW CONNECTIONS
to verify that the connection in the source account is the primary connection. If it
is not the primary connection, use the
ALTER CONNECTION
command to promote the connection in the source
account to serve as the primary connection.
If an Okta SCIM security integration is already configured in the source account, skip to the next step.
Otherwise, configure an
Okta SCIM
security integration in the source account.

Copy
Be sure to update the Okta SCIM application for Snowflake. For details, see
Okta configuration
.
In Okta,
create a new user
in the Okta application for Snowflake.
Verify the user is pushed to Snowflake by executing a
SHOW USERS
command in Snowflake.
If the failover group already specifies
security
integrations
, skip to the next step. This would be true if you have already
configured the failover group for the purposes of
SAML SSO in the target account
(in this topic).
Otherwise, modify the existing failover group using an ALTER FAILOVER GROUP command to specify
security
integrations
.
ALTER

fg
SET
OBJECT_TYPES
=
users
,
roles
,
warehouses
,
resource monitors
,
integrations
ALLOWED_INTEGRATION_TYPES
=
security
integrations
;
Copy
At this point, you can optionally refresh the secondary failover group as shown in the
target account steps for SCIM
to ensure the new user in the source account is in the target
account.
Choosing to refresh the secondary failover group now allows for an easy check to make sure that the change to the source account, adding
a new user in this sequence, is visible in the target account.
However, if you need or prefer to do additional work in the identity provider, such as modifying other users or updating role
assignments, you can continue doing that work now and then refresh the secondary failover group in one operation later.
Target account steps:
Prior to replication, verify the number of users and security integrations that are present in the target
account by executing the
SHOW USERS
and
SHOW INTEGRATIONS
commands, respectively.
Refresh the secondary failover group to update the target account to include the new user
(and any other changes that were made in Okta and the source account).
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
REFRESH
;
Copy
Verify that the new user is added to the target account by executing a
SHOW USERS
command.
Optionally, promote the secondary failover group and the secondary connection in the target account to primary. This will promote the
target account to serve as the new source account.

Replicating OAuth security integrations
¶
Replicating OAuth security integrations includes both Snowflake OAuth security integrations and External OAuth security integrations.
Note the following:
Snowflake OAuth
:
After replication and configuring failover/failback, a user connecting to either the source account or target account via an OAuth client
does not need to re-authenticate to the target account.
External OAuth
:
After replication and configuring failover/failback, a user connecting to either the source account or target account via an OAuth client
might
need to re-authenticate to the target account.
Re-authentication is likely to be necessary if the OAuth authorization server is not configured to issue a refresh token. Therefore,
ensure that the OAuth authorization server issues refresh tokens so that the OAuth client can connect to the source and target Snowflake
accounts.
For this procedure, assume the following:
Source account:
https://example-northamericawest.snowflakecomputing.com/
Target account:
https://example-northamericaeast.snowflakecomputing.com/
Connection URL:
https://example-global.snowflakecomputing.com
A secondary connection exists in the target account (i.e. only refresh operations are needed).
The Snowflake OAuth or External OAuth security integrations already exist in the source account.
This procedure is a representative example to do the following:
Replicate an OAuth security integration.
Refresh the failover group.
Promote the secondary connection in the target account to serve as the primary connection.
Source account steps:
If the failover group already specifies
security
integrations
, skip to the next step. This would be true if you have already
configured the failover group for the purposes of
SAML SSO in the target account
(in this topic) or
SCIM
(also in this topic).
Otherwise, modify the existing failover group using an ALTER FAILOVER GROUP command to specify
security
integrations
.
ALTER

fg
SET
OBJECT_TYPES
=
users

Target account steps:
Refresh the secondary failover group to update the target account to include the OAuth security integration objects.
ALTER

fg

Verify connecting to each Snowflake account using the OAuth client of your choice.
Optionally, promote the secondary failover group and the secondary connection in the target account to primary. This will promote the
target account to serve as the new source account.
Failover group:
ALTER
FAILOVER

Connection:

If you completed the previous step, reverify that you can connect to each Snowflake account using the OAuth client of your choice.
Replicating network policies
¶
Replicating a network policy from the source account to the target account allows administrators to restrict access to the target account
based on the network identifier of the origin of an incoming request.
Replicating network policy references and assignments
¶
Replicating a network policy replicates the network policy object
and
any network policy references/assignments. For example, if a
network policy references a network rule in the source account, and both objects exist in the target account, then the network policy uses
the same network rule in the target account. Similarly, if a network policy is assigned to a user and the user exists in both the source and
target accounts, replicating the network policy assigns the network policy to the user in the target account.
Replicating network policy references and assignments assumes referenced objects and objects to which the network policy is assigned are
also replicated. If you do not replicate the supporting object types properly, Snowflake fails the refresh operation in the target account.
If a referenced object or object to which the network policy is assigned does not already exist in the target account, include its object
type in the same replication or failover group as the network policy. The following examples demonstrate the required settings if the
supporting objects do not already exist in the target account.
Network policies that use network rules
The replication or failover group must include
network
policies
and
databases
. Network rules are schema-level objects
and are replicated with the database in which they are contained. For example:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
OBJECT_TYPES
=
network policies
,
databases
ALLOWED_DATABASES
=
testdb2
ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS
=
myorg
.
myaccount2
;
Copy
Network policies assigned to an account
The replication or failover group must include
network
policies
and
account
parameters
. If the network policy uses
network rules, you must also include
databases
. For example:
CREATE
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
OBJECT_TYPES

,
account

,
databases
ALLOWED_DATABASES

ALLOWED_ACCOUNTS

Copy
Network policies assigned to a user
The replication or failover group must include

fg
OBJECT_TYPES

Example
¶
For this example, assume the following:
Source account:
https://example-northamericawest.snowflakecomputing.com/
Target account:
https://example-northamericaeast.snowflakecomputing.com/
Connection URL:
https://example-global.snowflakecomputing.com
A secondary connection exists in the target account (i.e. only refresh operations are needed).
Network policies exist in the source account.
The Snowflake OAuth and/or SCIM security integration already exists in the source account and the integration specifies a network policy.
This procedural example does the following:
Replicates network policies along with the network rules that is uses to restrict network traffic.
Replicates a security integration to which the network policy is assigned.
Refreshes the failover group.
Verifies the network policy activation.
Promotes the secondary connection in the source account to serve as the primary connection.
Source account steps:
Verify that network policies exist in the source Snowflake account by executing a
SHOW NETWORK POLICIES
command.
Verify the Snowflake OAuth and/or SCIM security integrations include a network policy by executing a
SHOW INTEGRATIONS
command to identify the security integration and then execute a
DESCRIBE INTEGRATION
command on the Snowflake OAuth security integration.
Update the failover group to include
network
policies
and
account
parameters
using an ALTER FAILOVER GROUP command.
ALTER
FAILOVER

SET
OBJECT_TYPES
=

Copy
Target account steps:
Refresh the secondary failover group to update the target account to include the network policy objects and the Snowflake OAuth
security integration that specifies the network policy.
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
REFRESH
;
Copy
Verify the network policy object exists by executing a SHOW NETWORK POLICIES command, and verify the Snowflake OAuth security
integration specifies the replicated network policy by executing a DESCRIBE SECURITY INTEGRATION command on the security integration.
Verify the network policy activation as shown in
Identify an activated network policy
.
Verify connecting to each Snowflake account using the Snowflake OAuth client of your choice.
Optionally promote the secondary failover group and the secondary connection in the target account to primary. This will promote the
target account to serve as the new source account.
Failover group:
ALTER
FAILOVER
GROUP
fg
PRIMARY
;
Copy
Connection:
ALTER

global
PRIMARY
;
Copy
If you completed the previous step, reverify that you can connect to each Snowflake account using the Snowflake OAuth client of your
choice.
Replicating integrations and objects for the Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow
¶
The
Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow
allows Snowflake to ingest data from ServiceNow. The connector requires the following objects in
your Snowflake account:
Secret.
Security integration of
type
=
api_authentication
.
API integration.
Database to store the ingested data.
Warehouse for the connector to use.
Account roles to manage the access to these objects.
You create these objects prior to installing the connector and you can replicate these objects to the target account. After replicating
these objects, you can install the connector in the target account. The connector must be installed in the target account because the
installation depends on a share that Snowflake provides. You need to create a database from the share during the connector installation and
you cannot replicate a database that is created from a share.
Depending on how you want to manage the replication of account objects, you can have one or more replication or failover groups. A single
replication group centralizes the replication management of the objects and avoids scenarios where some objects are replicated and other
objects are not replicated. Otherwise, you must coordinate the replication operation carefully to ensure that all objects are replicated to
the target account.
For example, you can have a replication group for databases. This replication group (e.g.
rg1
) specifies the database that contains the
secret and the database to store the ServiceNow data. The other replication group (e.g.
rg2
) specifies the user, role, and integration
objects and the grants of these roles to users. In this scenario, if you replicate the integrations first and then decide to refresh the
target account to include the secret database, users, and roles, the replication refresh operation is successful.
However, if you replicate the users and roles and the database that contains the secret in a group before you replicate the integration,
then a placeholder secret is used until the security integration is replicated; the placeholder secret prevents a dangling reference. Once
the security integration is replicated, the placeholder secret is replaced with the real secret.
This procedure is a representative example to do the following:
Replicate the integrations and the databases containing the secret and ingested data.
Refresh the failover group.
Promote the secondary connection in the source account to serve as the primary connection.
Install and use the connector after replication.
For this procedure, assume the following:
Source account:
https://example-northamericawest.snowflakecomputing.com/
Target account:
https://example-northamericaeast.snowflakecomputing.com/
Connection URL:
https://example-global.snowflakecomputing.com
A secondary connection exists in the target account (i.e. only refresh operations are needed).
Other security integrations for authentication and network policies to restrict access are already replicated.
Source account steps:
Verify that the objects for the connector exist in the source Snowflake account by executing SHOW commands on each of these object types.

account to use the connector.
Update the remote service associated with the API integration in the cloud platform that hosts your Snowflake account.
